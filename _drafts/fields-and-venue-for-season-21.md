### **Back to our Roots**

We are also pleased to announce that the DCGFFL has secured fall permits for our Fall 2021 Season:

#### The Carter Barron Soccer Fields!

The Fields are located at 1698 Kennedy St NW, Washington, DC 20011.  
  
The Board worked hard to pursue a wide range of options. While we enjoyed the turf Fields at RFK in 2019, they are not providing permits to non-youth sports leagues at this time. We're excited to get back to where it all started, and where our players have said they have the most fun!

### **Sunday Funday Partner for Season 21**

We are pleased to announce our official post-game sponsor for Season XXI! Drum roll please...

#### THE DIRTY GOOSE!

Please join us every Sunday following the games to relax and enjoy a beverage or two at The Dirty Goose located on 913 U St NW, Washington, DC 20001. The Dirty Goose is owned by two of our own DCGFFL family members, Justin Parker and Daniel Honeycutt, who themselves met in the league. We are excited to continue their long history of support for the DCGFFL as our featured sponsor for 2021. Come out and show your DCGFFL pride!  
  
We showed up to the Goose in style this past weekend for what's sure to be a great preview of Sunday Fundays to come!
