<p>The Recreation League starts this Sunday at 12:45pm! Â Rec is a supplemental league that runs in tandem to the regular league and is primarily for those who want to develop their skills, try new positions, or try out the DCGFFL for the first time. It is open to everyone, even those not playing in the regular season, but highly skilled players (e.g. travel team players or consistent MVP recipients) may be restricted at the captains' discretion. Games will be on Sundays at 12:45pm from Oct 16 - 30th. Playoffs will be Nov 4 &amp; 6.</p>
