##### EARLYBIRD REGISTRATION:

Earlybird Registration opens **Wednesday, January 18th at 7 PM**. At that time, players should refresh the registration link on the website banner until the form is active.

This registration period is limited to 100 slots for returning players. Once all the slots are filled, registration will close temporarily and will not reopen until January 25th. Earlybird registration typically fills up within an hour, so register promptly at 7 PM to secure your spot!

##### REGULAR REGISTRATION:

Regular Registration for ALL players and social members will open on **Wednesday, January 25th, at 7 PM**.  If you haven't played in the DCGFFL previously or if you're a returning player who missed out on the earlybird slots, come back and sign up then!

_Registration fills up fast_. **Regular Registration will remain open until Monday, February 6th at 7 PM**, but don't delay! Register immediately at 7 PM to secure your spot and avoid the waitlist! We do our best to place everyone who registers on a team, but we cannot guarantee that we will have space to add everyone from the waitlist.

##### NEW PLAYERS:

New players (those who have not played in a regular season of the DCGFFL) are required to attend one of the New Player Workshops to be eligible to play in our league. Visit the [Events](https://dcgffl.org/events/) page for more information on the workshops including dates and locations.
