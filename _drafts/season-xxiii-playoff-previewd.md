### It's Playoff Time!

After a 9-game regular season played in only 6 weeks, we've finally arrived at the playoffs! [I Run Gay](https://dcgffl.org/teams/s23-iron-grey/ "I Run Gay") and the [Foamosexuals](https://dcgffl.org/teams/s23-seafoam-green/ "Foamosexuals") finished at the top of their respective divisions. Will these two teams make the Final Four or do others have an upset in store?

The first and second rounds of the playoffs will be played on Sunday, November 13, 2022.  The final 4 teams will play in the semifinals, and the winners will settle it all in the championship the following weekend on Sunday, November 20, 2022.
