### Represent DC Across the Nation!

Interested in traveling with a DC flag football team to compete against other league teams across North America? The DCGFFL’s wealth of talent comes together annually to represent DC at two national travel tournaments — Pride Bowl (Chicago, early June) and Gay Bowl (annually rotating city, early fall).

Registration for all DC Travel teams, for both Pride Bowl and Gay Bowl, opens today. There will be 2 Tryout options: THIS Sunday (3/27) after games (and league supplemental tryouts) at Carter Barron and next Saturday (4/2) at 10AM at Fort Circle Park (Ft. Totten, South Dakota Ave NE and Galloway St NE).  Registration will close on Monday, April 4th at noon but you are strongly encouraged to register early.  You will learn about your selection by Saturday, April 9th.
