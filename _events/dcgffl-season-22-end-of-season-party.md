**And...just like that! Season XXII is nearing a close! Letâ€™s finish in style**

To celebrate the end of this great season, join us Sunday May 22 after the championship game for our Season XXII End Party at The Dirty Goose!

Following games, we invite all league members to a VIP Season End Party from 3pm-7pm.  The Dirty Goose rooftop is EXCLUSIVELY reserved for us, so make sure to contact your team leaders to get wrist bands and access the after party!

Season Awards will be announced at this event, so come out and celebrate the champions, and party with your league mates to commemorate the end of another epic season!
