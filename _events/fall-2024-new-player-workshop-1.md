New Player Workshops are opportunities for new players to develop and demonstrate their flag football skills, which helps ensure that fair teams are selected.

Please note that if you have not played in the DCGFFL before, you **MUST** attend at least ONE of the New Player Workshops to be eligible for playing in a season. Each workshop will last about 1.5-2 hours and will consist of three sections: 1) a warm-up with one-on-one route running, 2) stations to learn about offense and defense in the league, 3) a pick-up game with veterans.

**ALL New Players who register are REQUIRED**&nbsp;to attend&nbsp;**<u>at least one</u>**&nbsp;New Player Workshop to be eligible to play. &nbsp;

This is **NOT** a tryout, just a way for us to make sure teams are picked fairly! If you registered on time, paid the registration fee, and show up to a workshop, you’ll get on a team. We’ll also try to get as many people off the waitlist as possible, so if you are a waitlisted new player, be sure to come!

**As another option,** [**New Player Workshop \#2**](/s26-npw-2)&nbsp;**will be held on Wednesday, Aug 21 at 6:30 - 8:30 PM (Harry Thomas Recreation Center).**
