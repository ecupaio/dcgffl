Every season, the DCGFFL brings players, family, and friends from all across the area to come together and celebrate the beginning of a new season at the Team Announcement Party (TAP).

If you are playing during the Fall 2024 season, &nbsp;come out to meet your new teammates, find out which Captain-QB pair drafted you, discuss strategy, and schedule your practices! Don’t forget to wear a shirt matching your team color, which will be announced just before the event.

Don’t miss this epic event and launch of the new season!
