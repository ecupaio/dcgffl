**_(UPDATE!):_** _New Player Workshop #1 is being moved to SATURDAY, February 11th from 1-3 PM at Carter Barron. We are strongly encouraging all new players to attend the workshops on either Saturday 2/11 or Wednesday 2/15._

New Player Workshops are opportunities for new players to develop and demonstrate their flag football skills, which helps ensure that fair teams are selected.

Please note that if you have not played in the DCGFFL before, you MUST attend at least ONE of the New Player Workshops to be eligible for playing in a season. Each workshop will last about 1.5-2 hours and will consist of three sections: 1) a warm-up with one-on-one route running, 2) stations to learn about offense and defense in the league, 3) a pick-up game with veterans.

This is NOT a tryout, just a way for us to make sure teams are picked fairly! If you registered on time, paid the registration fee, and show up to a workshop, you’ll get on a team. You only need to attend ONE of the two workshops to be eligible. We’ll also try to get as many people off the waitlist as possible, so if you are a waitlisted new player, be sure to come!

**As another option,** [**New Player Workshop #2**](/s24-npw-2 "/s24-npw-2") **will be held on Wednesday, February 15 at 8 PM at Edgewood Recreation Center.**

**_(UPDATED!) Rain Makeup Date:_** We are STRONGLY encouraging all new players to attend Workshop #1 or #2! **_The previously scheduled makeup workshop (Tuesday, February 21 - 8 PM at Brentwood Hamilton Field) will only be held if we do not have a full draft board and have remaining slots for new players._**
