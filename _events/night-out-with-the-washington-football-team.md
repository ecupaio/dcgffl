* **Buses Leave at 5:30 & 6 PM:** Team DC will provide two buses to take people to and from the game. **The cost is only an additional $20 per person/round trip.** **Buses will pick up and drop off at Pitchers Bar. Tentative Schedule:** The first bus leaves at 5:30; the second at 6:00. The first bus returns after the 3rd Quarter; the second bus at end of the game. **Masks are required on buses unless drinking.**
* **Pre-game Party Tickets:** Starts at 6:30 PM. Unlimited Buffet with Open Wine and Beer Bar! **Just $28 per person!!!**
* **Game Tickets:** The game starts at 8:20 PM. **Prices are $30 - Upper Level; $70 - Lower Level; and $130 - Club Level. (Price for bus and pre-game tickets are in addition to game ticket prices.)**

\***Total package ticket: $20 for bus, $28 for unlimited food, wine, and beer, plus $30/70/130 depending on seat tier = $78 Upper Level/ $118 Lower Level/ $178 Club Level. Subtract $10 from each for each package deal ticket (total cost $68/$108/$168) if you're in the first 50 to book a full package of bus + seat + pregame party!**
