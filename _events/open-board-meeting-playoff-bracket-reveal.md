#### Open Board Meeting

Each season, the Board holds a meeting open to the active members.  Thinking about running for an open board position and want to learn more about how the league is run? Come attend at 7pm!

#### Playoff Bracket Reveal

Following the board meeting, at 8:30pm, you'll get the first look at the Season XXII Playoff Bracket!  Who will you face off in Playoffs the following weekend?!?  Come and find out!

#### Playoff Format and Seeding

Our 18-team season will conclude with a single-elimination tournament across two Sundays.  On May 15th, a total of 14 games will be played to end the day with Final Four teams.  These teams will face off in the semifinals and super bowl on May 22.

Each of the two divisions will have teams ranked 1-9, based on overall record, with ties settled by one-on-one record. The odd teams from the Kiki Division will play the even teams from the Dirty Goose Division and vice versa. The four teams that are seeded 8th and 9th in their division will play in cross-divisional matchups in the two early games, following which, the remaining games will resemble a standard "sweet 16" bracket.
