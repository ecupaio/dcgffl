If you registered as a prospective quarterback and have not previously played quarterback during a regular season of the DCGFFL, you're required to attend the QB Tryout to be eligible for selection as QB.

Come prepared to demonstrate your ability to:

• throw quick, accurate passes to receivers running routes  
• select and communicate play calls  
• manage a huddle and individual player assignments

Returning QBs and prospective captains are invited to attend and participate in the workshop as well.

**_Rain Makeup Date_**: Sunday, February 5th - 1 PM at Carter Barron Fields  
The makeup date will only be used if inclement weather requires postponement of the tryout on February 4th.
