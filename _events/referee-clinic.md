The DCGFFL relies on player referees to ensure fair enforcement of the rules. Each season is a learning experience for both veterans and rookies alike, whether through improving [knowledge of the rules](https://ngffl.org/rules-of-play), [practicing good referee mechanics](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxQGJKmHS-rPTzRmYW5qbWIxTndhSGJLRWdMbWI4VXI5ZG1J/view?usp=sharing), or simply recognizing what [proper blocking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0iVwQmWUJs) (h/t Greater Philadelphia Flag Football) or various rules infractions look like in practice, not just in theory.

Referee clinics help jump start that learning experience. If you want to volunteer to ref, we recommend you attend this clinic as it will qualify you to be reimbursed for each game you ref this season.

Even if you don't plan to be a referee, we still recommend attending since it will help you understand what referees are looking for on the field and how rules will be enforced.
