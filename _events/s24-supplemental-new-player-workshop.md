Miss out on regular registration, and want to join for the rest of the spring season??  Be sure to register for supplemental registration!  If you are a new player, you must also attend this workshop to be eligible.

New Player Workshops are opportunities for new players to develop and demonstrate their flag football skills, which helps ensure that fair teams are selected. The workshop will last about 1 hour and will consist of three sections: 1) a warm-up with one-on-one route running, 2) stations to learn about offense and defense in the league, 3) a pick-up game with veterans.

This is NOT a tryout, just a way for us to make sure teams are picked fairly! If you registered on time, paid the registration fee, and show up to a workshop, you’ll get on a team. You only need to attend ONE of the two workshops to be eligible. We’ll also try to get as many people off the waitlist as possible, so if you are a waitlisted new player, be sure to come!

**As another option,** [**New Player Workshop #1**](/s24-npw-1 "/s24-npw-1") **will be held on Saturday, February 11 at 1 PM at Carter Barron Soccer Fields (new date!).**

**_(UPDATED!) Rain Makeup Date:_** We are STRONGLY encouraging all new players to attend Workshop #1 or #2! **_The previously scheduled makeup workshop (Tuesday, February 21 - 8 PM at Brentwood Hamilton Field) will only be held if we do not have a full draft board and have remaining slots for new players._**
