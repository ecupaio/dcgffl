Mark your calendars for the first week of Season 1 games, March 13!  

* **Arrive Early!** Talk to your captain about how far in advance you should arrive to ensure you  warm up with your team.
* **Stretch!** In cold weather, it's very important to stretch before the games to help reduce the risk of injury. 
* **Wear pocketless shorts!** If you ordered shorts when you registered, see JJ at the Referee Tent on game day.
* **Bring cleats, sunscreen, water, and football gloves.**

Stay tuned for team schedules, coming out soon!
