Miss out on regular registration, and want to join for the rest of the spring season??  Be sure to register for supplemental registration!  If you are a new player, you must also attend this workshop to be eligible.

New Player Workshops are opportunities for new players to develop and demonstrate their flag football skills, which helps ensure that fair teams are selected. The workshop will last about 1 hour and will consist of three sections: 1) a warm-up with one-on-one route running, 2) stations to learn about offense and defense in the league, 3) a pick-up game with veterans.

Please note that if you have not played in the DCGFFL before, and you did NOT already attend a workshop in February, you MUST attend the New Player Workshop to be eligible for playing in a season.

##### Be sure to [Register for Supplemental Here](https://forms.gle/GhYKhkFAiwbShTSDA "https://forms.gle/GhYKhkFAiwbShTSDA")!
