The DCGFFL Travel Program offers the opportunity for the league's wealth of talent to represent DC and compete against the players from other leagues across the country and Canada.&nbsp;

The DCGFFL travel teams will compete in three tournaments this year â€” **Pride Bowl** (June 28-29, 2024 in Chicago),&nbsp;**Gay Bowl** (October 31-November 3, 2024 in Austin), and&nbsp;**Philly Special** (May 25-26, 2024 in Philadelphia). The DCGFFL Women's travel teams are hosting tryouts for the 2024 season.

The **DC Senators** are looking to field **two teams** and we're excited to have even better showings at tournaments this year. So come out and show us what you got!&nbsp;
