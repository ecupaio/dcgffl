Mark your calendars - Regular Registration for ALL players (both NEW and RETURNING players who didn't sign up during early registration) will open on **Wednesday, January 25th at 7 PM!** At that time, refresh the registration link on the website banner until the form is active. This will register you for the Spring 2023 season (Season XXIV), which runs from March to late May.

_Registration fills up fast_. **Regular Registration will remain open until Monday, February 6th at 7 PM**, but don't delay! Register immediately at 7pm to secure your spot and avoid the waitlist! We do our best to place everyone who registers on a team, but we cannot guarantee that we will have space to add everyone from the waitlist.

The registration fee is $90 for new players and $75 for returning players.  You can submit your payment via Venmo (@dcgffl under ‘Business’) or PayPal ([https://dcgffl.org/donate/](https://dcgffl.org/donate/ "https://dcgffl.org/donate/")).

#### **A NOTE FOR NEW PLAYERS**

**Once registered, new players are required to attend at least one New Player Workshop to be eligible to play.** The dates for the new player workshops are [February 12](/s24-npw-1) (1 PM, Carter Barron) and a second date to be announced. **Please contact us at** [**DCGayFlagFootball@gmail.com**](mailto:DCGayFlagFootball@gmail.com?subject=Question%20about%20Season%20XXII%20Registration) **if you have any questions!**
