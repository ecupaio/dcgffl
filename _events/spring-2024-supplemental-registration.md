<br>**Note:** Similar to regular season registration, we may not be able to add every player who registers due to a cap on team size. Payment of the player registration fee ($90) will not be requested until March 29th once we have confirmed we can add you to a team. Players selected during the Supplemental Draft will be eligible to play beginning with Week 4 games on Sunday, March 31.

<br>**Supplemental New Player Workshop (Sunday, March 24 at 2 PM)**<br>**Please note that if you have not played in the DCGFFL before, you MUST attend this New Player Workshop to be eligible for playing in this season.** The workshop will last about one hour and will consist of three sections: 1) a warm-up with one-on-one route running, 2) stations to learn about offense and defense in the league, 3) a pick-up game with veterans.
