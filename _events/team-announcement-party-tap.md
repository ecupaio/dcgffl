Every season, the DCGFFL brings players, family, and fans from all across the area to come together and celebrate the beginning of a new season at the Team Announcement Party.

If you are playing in Season 21, come out to meet your new teammates, find out which captain-QB pair drafted you, discuss strategy, and schedule your practices. Don't forget to wear a shirt matching your team color, which will be announced just before the event.  

Don't miss this epic event and launch of the new season!
