  rules_1_title: General Rules of Play Overview
  _rules_1_title: field_53
  rules_1_text: 'Each game is played in two 30 minute halves with a 10 minute break
    at halftime (unless otherwise agreed to by opposing captains). The game clock
    runs continuously until the final two minutes of each half, unless stopped by
    a timeout.  In the second half, two-minute rules apply. There is a 30-second play
    clock between plays. The league allows 3 additional plays in each half after the
    game clock has expired. Each team gets 4 timeouts per non-overtime game and can
    use up to 3 in a single half. '
  _rules_1_text: field_54
  rules_2_title: Offense
  _rules_2_title: field_53
  rules_2_text: "• A first down is awarded after ten yards, unless modified by penalties.
    \   \r\n\r\n• There are no fumbles – the ball is dead when it touches the ground\r\n\r\n•
    Ball must be on the ground for a snap.\L\L\r\n\r\n• Only one running play (including
    a QB scramble across the line of scrimmage) per series of downs.\L\L\r\n\r\n•
    QB is across the line of scrimmage (and therefore cannot make a legal forward
    pass) if either of his feet are across the line. If his entire body is across
    the line but his feet are behind it, the forward pass is legal. If he’s doing
    the splits and only his foot is across the line, it’s still illegal. It only takes
    1 foot across the line to be illegal.\L\L\r\n\r\n• Every offensive must be set
    for one full second before the snap.\L\L  After being set, a player is allowed
    to go in motion.  If multiple players are in motion, every player needs to re-set.
    \ Only one player may be in motion parallel to the line of scrimmage at the time
    of the snap.\r\n\r\n• There is no penalty for intentional grounding by the QB.\L\L\r\n\r\n•
    No flag guarding is allowed, including stiff-arming, lower your head or shoulder
    when running with the ball, running with your hands below your waist, or hurdling
    to avoid being de-flagged.  Spinning and lateral jumps (where the flags do not
    change height) are allowed.\r\n\r\n• No charging into an opponent – a ball carrier
    must go around a stationary player.\L\L\r\n\r\n• Teammates cannot push or pull
    a runner with the ball.\L\r\n\r\n\L• Receiver needs to get one foot in bounds
    with possession of ball for a legal catch.\L\L\r\n\r\n• Downfield blocking is
    allowed after a receiver makes a catch or a runner has crossed the line of scrimmage.
    Regular blocking rules (described below) apply. Note: 2 on 1 blocking is only
    allowed in the neutral zone and behind it."
  _rules_2_text: field_54
  rules_3_title: Blocking
  _rules_3_title: field_53
  rules_3_text: "• A blocker is allowed to contact only that portion of the opponent's
    body between the waist and shoulders and the blocker's hands or forearms must
    be in front or to the side of the player being blocked.\L\L\r\n\r\n• A blocker’s
    arms cannot be fully extended.\r\n\r\n\L\L• Hands must always be in advance of
    the elbows and the arms must be flexed at the elbows.\L\L\r\n\r\n• In any block,
    the hands or arms may not be swinging forward faster than the blocker’s body.
    Players must block with hands and elbows within the frame of their body.\r\n"
  _rules_3_text: field_54
  rules_4_title: Defense
  _rules_4_title: field_53
  rules_4_text: "• When rushing as a defender, you must be beyond the neutral zone
    which extends to 5 yards from the line of scrimmage. When the ball is hiked you
    can immediately rush from this position. There is no limit to the number of people
    who can rush from this position.\L\L\r\n\r\n• A pass rusher must avoid charging
    into a blocker. When encountering a blocker, a pass rusher must (a) stop prior
    to making contact with the blocker or (b) clearly change direction in an effort
    to move around the blocker.\L\L\r\n\r\n• If a pass rusher makes an effort to move
    around the blocker and the blocker moves into the path of the pass rusher, there
    is no charging.\L\L\r\n\r\n• Rushing Exception: You CAN rush from the line of
    scrimmage (not 5 yards deep) once a rusher who has lined up 5 yards back has crossed
    the line of scrimmage.  For example: If you line up on the line of scrimmage you
    must wait until one of the rushers who lined up 5 yards off the line of scrimmage
    crosses the line before you can rush in.  Rush restrictions end once a QB passes
    the football.  \r\n\r\n\L• \"Tackling\" -- Only way to \"tackle\" a ball-carrier
    is to remove his flag. A defender can't push the player out of bounds or try to
    knock him down. A defender is not allowed to obstruct the forward progress of
    a ball-carrier.\L\L\r\n\r\n• Defenders are allowed to contact receivers within
    5 yards of the line of scrimmage. Blocking rules apply here as well. Defenders
    cannot have contact with the receiver (other than incidental) beyond 5 yards.
    When defending a pass, defenders must make a play on the ball only."
  _rules_4_text: field_54
  rules_5_title: Kicking
  _rules_5_title: field_53
  rules_5_text: "• No player can move until the ball is kicked. Receiving team must
    have at least 4 players between their 30 yard line and midfield. At least 4 receivers
    must remain in this area until the ball is kicked.\L\L\r\n\r\n• Punts -- Fourth
    down punts have to be announced (teams can quick-kick on any other down). For
    announced punts all teammates of the kicker must be within 1 yard of the line
    of scrimmage. Kicker must be 5 yards from the line when he receives the snap.\L\L\r\n\r\n•
    Receiving team must have 4 players within one yard beyond the line of scrimmage
    until after the ball is kicked. No receiver can cross or move off the line of
    scrimmage until after the ball is kicked."
  _rules_5_text: field_54
  rules_6_title: Points
  _rules_6_title: field_53
  rules_6_text: "• Touchdowns are 6 points.  \r\n\r\n• Following a touchdown, an extra
    point can be made by converting a play from the 5 yard line or two extra points
    by converting from the 10. Running is allowed on all extra point tries.\r\n\r\n•
    A team may change their decision on a 1-or 2-point try after using a team timeout.\L\L\r\n\r\n•
    If a team intercepts a pass or fumble during the try and returns it for a touchdown,
    the team scores 2 points.\L\L\r\n\r\n• During a try, after a change of possession,
    if a foul occurs that directly affects the runner (holding, personal foul, tripping),
    then the runner’s team shall be awarded an attempt to try for 2 points from the
    10 yard line.\L\L\r\n\r\n• During a try, after a change of possession, if there’s
    a foul that does not affect the runner, the penalty is assessed from the succeeding
    spot (the 15 yard line on the start of the next possession)."
  _rules_6_text: field_54
  rules_7_title: Highlighted Rule Clarifications
  _rules_7_title: field_53
  rules_7_text: "• A player is not penalized for participating in a down without a
    flag belt. If a player is not wearing a flag belt at the snap, the ball becomes
    dead immediately if that player possesses the ball. If a player’s belt falls off
    during a play, a 1-hand touch is required to end the down.\L\L\r\n\r\n• Towels
    may be worn by the center only and must not interfere with the positioning of
    his / her flags.\L\L\r\n\r\n• If an illegal forward pass (ie, the QB throws the
    ball after crossing the line of scrimmage) occurs within 1 yard of the line of
    scrimmage, the penalty is 5 yards and a loss of down -- in this case, the QB will
    retain his run. However, if an illegal forward pass clearly occurs beyond 1 yard
    from the line of scrimmage, the same penalty applies AND the QB loses his run
    for that possession.\L\L\r\n\r\n• An errant snap that touches the ground is spotted
    at the previous spot and the down counts. In essence, it is treated as an incomplete
    pass.\L\L\r\n\r\n• A fumbled ball is dead once the ball touches the ground. If
    the ball is fumbled backwards, it is spotted where the ball touches the ground.
    If the ball is fumbled forward, it is spotted where the ball carrier lost possession.
    NOTE: an incomplete backwards pass is treated as a fumble and spotted where the
    ball touches the ground."
  _rules_7_text: field_54
  rules_8_title: Personal Fouls
  _rules_8_title: field_53
  rules_8_text: "The DCGFFL Board wants to reiterate League policy on personal fouls
    (unsportsmanlike conduct) to ensure the League remains a fun, safe, and harassment
    free environment in which to play football. \L\L\r\n\r\nAs outlined in the NGFFL
    rules, unsportsmanlike conduct includes:\L\L\r\n• Abusive, insulting, baiting
    or taunting language or gestures\L\r\n• Unnecessary roughness or overly physical
    conduct during or following a down\L\r\n• Spiking the ball or throwing the ball
    from the field of play\L\r\n• Insubordination towards a referee\r\n• Any other
    conduct deemed unsportsmanlike, dangerous, or unbecoming as determined by any
    referee of a given game\L\L\r\n\r\nAny player committing an act that the referee
    deems flagrant and semi-violent (such as throwing a ball at another player after
    play has ended) will be assigned a personal foul and will be automatically ejected
    for 8 downs / scrimmage plays.  The player’s team will also receive a ten-yard
    penalty.  (Note: Since a kickoff does not count as scrimmage play, an ejected
    player may participate in the kickoff at the start of a half.  The kickoff does
    not account toward meeting the ejection period.)  \r\n\r\nViolent personal fouls
    (such as throwing a punch) will result in automatic ejection for the remainder
    of the game and for the following game and will be reported to the Board for investigation
    and potentially further action.\r\n\r\nAny player who accrues two (2) or more
    personal fouls in one (1) game will be suspended automatically for the remainder
    of that game and for the following game that he or she would otherwise play. Any
    player who accrues three (3) or more personal fouls over the course of one (1)
    season may face a full season suspension.\L\L\r\n\r\nThe DCGFFL Board reserves
    the right to review personal fouls and determine whether the severity of the foul
    and/or number of accumulated fouls merits disciplinary actions in addition to
    or separate from those listed above, including, but not limited to, partial or
    full suspension from future games or a full season suspension. Players and their
    team captains will be notified of personal fouls and any resulting disciplinary
    actions."

  rules_9_title: Policies - Play Every Play (PEP) Requirement
  _rules_9_title: field_53
  rules_9_text: "During the regular season, captains are required to play every eligible
    and uninjured player for one drive in each half of a game, which can be on either
    offense or defense.  Kickoffs do not count for purposes of fulfilling the PEP
    requirement.  \r\n\r\nThe DCGFFL Board reserves the right to review repeated infractions
    of this requirement by a captain and assign disciplinary action."
  _rules_9_text: field_54
  rules_10_title: Policies - Player Playoffs Eligibility
  _rules_10_title: field_53
  rules_10_text: Players are required to play at least half (rounded up), or four
    (4) weeks, of their available games in a season in order to be eligible to play
    during the playoffs.  Those starting at the beginning of the season need to play
    five (5) of the nine (9) season games, but those who join during the supplemental
    draft after  Week 3 only need to meet half of their team’s remaining games (e.g.
    if the team has 5 remaining games, the player only needs to attend 3).  Injury
    is the only exception to the game attendance requirement.
  _rules_10_text: field_54
  rules_11_title: Policies - Playoffs Seeding
  _rules_11_title: field_53
  rules_11_text: "The Board will use the following methodology to determine playoffs
    seeding.  This methodology is how the NGFFL seeds teams for Gay Bowl.  The working
    modus is that win-loss ratios should be the deciding factor in determining rankings.
    \ Point spreads are only if all sub-group analyses do not provide a winner:\r\n\r\n1)
    Overall Win-Loss Record:  Within each conference, teams will be ranked highest
    to lowest according to most wins.\r\n\r\n2) Ties: If two or more teams are tied
    with number of wins, then teams will be ranked highest to lowest according to
    most wins within the tied group.\r\n\r\na) If two or more teams are tied within
    a group for number of wins, then teams will be ranked highest to lowest according
    to most wins within the tied sub-group.  Sub-groups are analyzed as necessary.\r\n\r\nb)
    If teams are still tied after considering applicable sub-groups, then ranking
    is determined by the point differential within the sub group.  If point differentials
    are the same, then expand to overall point differential.  If still tied, then
    the tie is decided by a coin flip.  The maximum point spread for any single game
    is ±36."
  _rules_11_text: field_54
  rules_12_title: Policies - Playoffs Scheduling
  _rules_12_title: field_53
  rules_12_text: "The DCGFFL uses a 20-team cross-conference bracket (see 'Sample
    Playoffs Bracket in the Important Information inset).  \r\n\r\n1) Odd Seeds from
    one conference will be on one side of the bracket while Even Seeds are on the
    other side of the bracket.  Except for #1 & #2 seeds, Odd Seeds of each conference
