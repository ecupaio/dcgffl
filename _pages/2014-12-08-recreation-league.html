<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>The Recreation League is a supplemental league that runs in tandem to the regular league and is primarily for those who want to develop their skills, try new positions, or try out the DCGFFL for the first time.  The Recreation League is open to everyone, even those not playing in the regular season.</p>
<p>Games are typically played on Fridays at the Brentwood Hamilton Fields (1300 6th St NE) in mid-April and mid-October.</p>

<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #993300; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Captains and QBs</strong></span></span></h4>
<p>Captains are selected from veterans of the regular league. Previous captaining experience is not required.</p>
<p>Each team has one or two QBs.  One QB may be a veteran QB who is or has QB’d in the regular league. This gives Rec players more consistent throws and play calling. The second QB is one who would like to QB for the regular league or would just like to try his or her hand at running an offense. Quarterbacks will switch every offensive series or half or as decided by the captains and QBs. However, secondary QBs must play at least one half if present.</p>
<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #993300; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Restricted Players</strong></span></span></h4>
<p>Highly skilled players (e.g. travel team players or consistent MVP recipients) may be restricted at the captains’ discretion. These players will be denoted on the team rosters with bold and are limited in the following ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>They cannot play their normal offensive and/or defensive position.</li>
<li>They may catch or intercept the ball, but they cannot advance it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Generally, these are players on a travel team or those who consistently obtain MVPs in the regular season.</p>
<p>The mission is to make the Recreation League a place where everyone has the chance to participate on both offense and defense.</p>
