<p>Welcome to the Travel Program information page for the DC Gay Flag Football League (DCGFFL).</p>
<p>COVID-19 AND IMPACT TO TRAVEL TOURNAMENTS<br />First and foremost, we hope you and your loved ones are safe and healthy during these uncertain times. For many of us, the DCGFFL community is a family and a way for us to have fun and get a release from the stress of day to day life.  We're eager to kick the momentum back up for 2021, and pick up right where we left off in 2019. Check back for updates on the status of this year's tournaments.</p>

<p>ABOUT THE TRAVEL PROGRAM<br />The DCGFFL’s wealth of talent comes together annually to represent DC at two national tournaments — Pride Bowl (Chicago, early June) and Gay Bowl (annually rotating city, early fall). 2019 was a phenomenal year for the DCGFFL Travel Program, every single DC team made the semifinals at Gay Bowl and for the second year in a row, the Generals took home the championship! We are incredibly proud of all our players!</p>
<p>Every year, we send our athletes to two major flag football tournaments, Pride Bowl and Gay Bowl, to represent DC against other national teams. Last year we fielded 1 women’s team (Senators in A division) and 4 men’s teams (Generals in A division; Admirals in A division; Commanders in B division; and Delta Force in C division). Each team is headed by a single captain, who selects the roster, manages the team, coordinates fundraising efforts, and makes sure the year runs smoothly for their travel team.</p>
<p>The current captains are:<br />Senators – Jayme Fuglesten<br />Generals – Marvin Washington<br />Admirals – Bryan Sanders<br />Commanders – Clay Arnold<br />Delta Force – Dameron Rendell</p>
<p>The Travel Program is managed by the Travel Management Board (TMB) with oversight by the DCGFFL Board of Directors. The TMB is made up of two representatives from each team and three unaffiliated members to act as independent administrators. Team representatives are chosen annually by the teams after the teams have been drafted. The unaffiliated members (the U3) are selected by a popular vote by anyone that registered for the current Travel season.</p>
<p><strong>The current TMB unaffiliated (U3) positions are vacant.  Please email <a href="mailto:DCGFFLTravel@gmail.com">DCGFFLTravel@gmail.com</a> if you're interested in volunteering!</strong></p>
<p>The Current TMB Affiliated Members are:<br />Kori Saunders (Washington Senators)<br />Rachel Browning (Washington Senators)<br />Brendan McFarland (DC Admirals)<br />Alonzo Mable (DC Admirals)<br />Mark Hofberg (Washington Generals)<br />Miles Simpson (Washington Generals)<br />Vincent Culliver (DC Commanders)<br />Mike Osorio (DC Commanders)<br />Ken Green (DC Delta Force)<br />Brian Jones (DC Delta Force)</p>
<p>Jim Roll is the DCGFFL Board Liaison to the TMB.</p>
