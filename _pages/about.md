  title: Frequently Asked Questions
  items:
  - q: Do I have to identify as LGBTQ+ to play?
    a: No! We welcome all participants, allies and LBGTQ+ community members alike,
      and we do not ask players to self-identify.
  - q: Do I need to have flag football experience to play?
    a: No!  We welcome all levels, from brand new to veteran footballer.  If you're
      a rookie, your captain and quarterback will work with you to learn the rules
      and develop your skills.  If you're a football all star, you'll find a competitive
      atmosphere with a lot of other talented players that will challenge you to play
      your best.
  - q: What equipment do I need to play?
    a: To avoid player injury from hands getting caught on pockets, players are required
      to wear pocketless shorts.  We also strongly recommend cleats (no metal studs)
      and football gloves.  Oh, and don't forget sunscreen and water!  The DCGFFL
      will provide you with jerseys and flag belts.  Quarterbacks must supply their
      own footballs.
  - q: How are teams picked?
    a: In order to ensure equitable teams, players are drafted onto new teams every
      season by the team captain and quarterback.  This means you get to meet and
      play with new people every season!
  - q: Is this more of a social or more of a competitive league?
    a: We strive to be both!  The experience is what you make of it - our players
      work hard and play hard.  A wide range of athletic talent is coupled with a
      wide range of social fun.  Join up and experience it yourself!

### History and Legacy

The DC Gay Flag Football League (DCGFFL) started in the mid 90's when two different groups of players began gathering for football.  The first group started playing together in 1994 at Francis Field near Dupont Circle, and the other began playing near the Washington Monument Mall in 1997.  In 1998, the groups came together and the base of DC gay flag football was set.

In 2003, the players created DC's first traveling team, the Washington Monuments, and competed in the National Gay Super Bowl in Boston. Only expecting to win a few games in their first national tournament, the Washington Monuments WON the tournament!  A second travel team, the DC Metros, was later created.

Another milestone for DC Gay Flag Football came in 2009, when the individuals involved in DC Gay Flag Football hosted Gay Bowl X, the national gay flag football tournament. Players from all over the country came to DC to play at Carter Barron Fields.

After years of informally gathering to play flag football, the DCGFFL launched its inaugural season in the Fall of 2010 as an official league.  Seven teams were created with 102 players, ending with the Orange Crush defeating Gang Green for the first league title. This championship game represented the culmination of years of hard work to bring a quality gay flag football league to Washington.

### A Thriving Community

Currently, the league fields 20 teams with approximately 270 players for a Fall and Spring season, hosts a summer tournament each year in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware and supports up to 5 [travel teams](/travel-program/) that participate in annual tournaments at other cities across the country.

It is only through the hard work and dedication of many men and women, both straight and gay, from the DC community, that this amazing league has become what it is today.   It is in this spirit that the DCGFFL is excited to see what the next 20 years brings for flag football in DC.
