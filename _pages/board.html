      statement: "I have been a player in the League since Season XVII, and I joined
        the Board at the end of Season XXI. For the past 6 months, I have served as
        your Director of Players, and in that time, I have gained first-hand experience
        with all functional aspects of gameplay and competition in the League, including
        efforts such as organizing preseason activities in the lead-up to the draft
        and developing the season and playoff schedules. \n\nAlthough I’ve only been
        on the Board for a short time, I have stepped up on several occasions in the
        Commissioner’s absence, including during the season and supplemental drafts,
        and in doing so have demonstrated that I have the necessary leadership and
        interpersonal skills to be successful in leading the Board and the entire
        League for the next two seasons (and hopefully longer). I am also confident
        that I will be able to work with the Directors on the Board to ensure that
        all other aspects of the League’s mission and operations will be successful
        under my guidance.\n\nAs your next Commissioner, I want to see the DCGFFL
        build on existing relationships and the foundation that was laid by those
        who founded and have led the league over the past 12+ years. I recognize that
        I won’t know everything from Day 1 (or even at the end of my term), but I
        will learn quickly and will know when to reach out to those who have come
        before me for guidance. I also want to see us continue to regrow the League
        since our Season XXI relaunch by establishing new relationships and developing
        the next generation of players and leaders who will lead the league for the
        next 10-15 years.\n\nI have truly enjoyed serving you over the course of this
        season, and I’m excited at the prospect of taking the next step in leading
        the DCGFFL. Thank you for your consideration, and I’d greatly appreciate your
        vote in the upcoming election."

      statement: "The DCGFFL has been a saving grace to me during one of the most
        difficult times of my life. So many members within leadership and throughout
        our community have stepped in to replace the family I lost during my transition
        period. I would love nothing more than to give back to an organization that
        has saved my life. \n\nAfter playing in the league for 3 seasons, traveling
        to Sunshine Cup to cheer on DC-based teams, and joining the Senators Black
        travel team, I feel that I have developed an intimate understanding of the
        mission of the league as an organization and what our community means to players.
        I believe my professional background of a Masters in Education and my career
        in digital media uniquely position me to deliver high-quality and informational
        communication via the website, social media, and email communication. Thank
        you for considering my candidacy."

    candidates:
    - name: Kevin Comerford
      image: "/img/comerford.jpeg"
      statement: |-
        Hey, football fam! I’m throwing my hat in for Director at Large. I’ve been a member of the DCGFFL since 2015, both as an active player for six seasons, and currently as a forever member of Buns of Steel. I served on the DCGFFL board back in 2016 as Social Director. During my time on the board I managed to increase league sponsorship funding to match the growing league, all while giving our leading sponsors twice the league presence as seasons prior. In the interim, I created an independent league, Rogue Cornhole, which currently is made up of 152 players and 32 teams. Now 6 seasons in, this league has made a huge impact on the community, with $36,000 raised for charity. I was most recently honored with the TeamDC MVP Award at the Night of Champions for my role in the creation of this league.

        During my time on the DCGFFL board, we not only revamped our sponsorship program, but also brought Rec league to its highest participation levels, and created the current structure of the Travel Management Committee.  My goals for this upcoming season include 1) championing women leadership and players, 2) expanding Rec league focus and participation, and 3) bringing ref scheduling into today’s technology with real time updates. I’m well versed in ref scheduling and will be a great asset to this league.
