    Welcome to the website for the DC Gay Flag Football League (DCGFFL), DC’s premier gay flag football league. The DCGFFL started informally in 1994 and became an official league in 2010. Since its early beginnings, the league has grown to over 200 players and has fielded as many as 20 teams in a season!  We’re a fun community of athletes, family, and friends, and we hope you’ll join and get to know us!
