  text: Welcome to the website for the DC Gay Flag Football League (DCGFFL), DC’s
    premier LGBTQ+ flag football league. The DCGFFL started informally in 1994 and
    became an official league in 2010. Since its early beginnings, the league has
    grown to over 200 players and has fielded as many as 20 teams in a season!  We’re
    a fun community of athletes, allies, family, and friends, and we hope you’ll join
    and get to know us!

- title: Travel Program
  text: The DCGFFL’s wealth of talent comes together annually to represent DC at two
    national tournaments — Pride Bowl (Chicago, early June) and Gay Bowl (annually
    rotating city, early fall). 2019 was a phenomenal year for the DCGFFL Travel Program,
    every single DC team made the semifinals at Gay Bowl and for the second year in
    a row, the Generals took home the championship! We are incredibly proud of all
    our players!
