  title: DCGFFL Rules Of Play
  text: >-
    The DC Gay Flag Football League follows the most recently adopted Gay Bowl
    rules, as written by the National Gay Flag Football League ([the rules can
    be accessed here](https://ngffl.org/rules-of-play)).


    A summary of the DCGFFL rules is provided below.


    Please contact the [DCGFFL Board of
    Directors](mailto:dcgayflagfootball@gmail.com) with any questions or
    clarifications.
rules:
  - title: General Rules Of Play Overview
    text: >-
      Each game is played in two 30 minute halves with a 5 minute break at
      halftime (unless otherwise agreed to by the opposing captains). The game
      clock runs continuously until the final two minutes of each half, unless
      stopped by a timeout.


      During the last two minutes of each half, the game clock will run
      according to high school football rules. For the following scenarios, the
      clock is stopped and will not restart until the next legal snap of a timed
      down: player’s timeouts, incomplete passes, changes of possession, scoring
      plays, and after a play ends out of bounds. In the event of offical
      timeouts and first downs, the game clock is stopped and it is restarted
      once the ball is spotted and the ready for play signal is given by the
      referee.


      Each team gets 4 timeouts per non-overtime game and can use up to 3 in a
      single half.
  - title: Offense
    text: >-
      * A first down is awarded after ten yards, unless modified by penalties.


      * There are no fumbles – the ball is dead when it touches the ground


      * Ball must be on the ground for a snap.


      * Only one running play (including a QB scramble across the line of
      scrimmage) per series of downs.


      * QB is across the line of scrimmage (and therefore cannot make a legal
      forward pass) if either foot is across the line. If the QB's entire body
      is across the line but the feet are behind it, the forward pass is legal.
      If the QB is doing the splits and only his foot is across the line, it’s
      still illegal. It only takes 1 foot across the line to be illegal.


      * Every offensive player must be set for one full second before the snap.
      After being set, a player is allowed to go in motion. If multiple players
      are in motion, every player needs to re-set. 

      * Only one player may be in motion parallel to the line of scrimmage at
      the time of the snap.


      * There is no penalty for intentional grounding by the QB.


      * No flag guarding is allowed, including stiff-arming, lower your head or
      shoulder when running with the ball, running with your hands below your
      waist, or hurdling to avoid being de-flagged. Spinning and lateral jumps
      (where the flags do not change height) are allowed.


      * No charging into an opponent – a ball carrier must go around a
      stationary player.


      * Teammates cannot push or pull a runner with the ball.


      * Receiver needs to get one foot in bounds with possession of ball for a
      legal catch.


      * Downfield blocking is allowed after a receiver makes a catch or a runner
      has crossed the line of scrimmage. Regular blocking rules (described
      below) apply. Note: 2 on 1 blocking is only allowed in the neutral zone
      and behind it.


      * Individual and/or group TD celebrations are permitted after scoring a
      touchdown or extra point. Celebrations must not be directed towards an
      opposing team or player. Celebrations must not be crude or sexually
      explicit. There will be no additional time provided for TD celebrations,
      so any delay of game penalty incurred due to a celebration will be
      enforced.
  - title: Blocking
    text: >-
      * A blocker is allowed to contact only that portion of the opponent's body
      between the waist and shoulders and the blocker's hands or forearms must
      be in front or to the side of the player being blocked.


      * In any block, the hands or arms may not be swinging forward faster than
      the blocker’s body. Players must block with hands and elbows within the
      frame of their body.
  - title: Defense
    text: >-
      * When rushing as a defender, you must be beyond the neutral zone which
      extends to 5 yards from the line of scrimmage. When the ball is hiked you
      can immediately rush from this position. There is no limit to the number
      of people who can rush from this position.


      * A pass rusher must avoid charging into a blocker. When encountering a
      blocker, a pass rusher must (a) stop prior to making contact with the
      blocker or (b) clearly change direction in an effort to move around the
      blocker.


      * If a pass rusher makes an effort to move around the blocker and the
      blocker moves into the path of the pass rusher, there is no charging.


      * Rushing Exception: You CAN rush from the line of scrimmage (not 5 yards
      deep) once a rusher who has lined up 5 yards back has crossed the line of
      scrimmage. For example: If you line up on the line of scrimmage you must
      wait until one of the rushers who lined up 5 yards off the line of
      scrimmage crosses the line before you can rush in. Rush restrictions end
      once a QB passes the football.


      * "Tackling" -- Only way to "tackle" a ball-carrier is to remove their
      flag. A defender can't push the player out of bounds or try to knock the
      player down. A defender is not allowed to obstruct the forward progress of
      a ball-carrier.


      * Defenders are allowed to contact receivers within 5 yards of the line of
      scrimmage. Blocking rules apply here as well. Defenders cannot have
      contact with the receiver (other than incidental) beyond 5 yards. When
      defending a pass, defenders must make a play on the ball only.
  - title: Kicking
    text: >-
      * No player can move until the ball is kicked. Receiving team must have at
      least 4 players between their 30 yard line and midfield. At least 4
      receivers must remain in this area until the ball is kicked.


      * Punts -- Fourth down punts have to be announced (teams can quick-kick on
      any other down). For announced punts all teammates of the kicker must be
      within 1 yard of the line of scrimmage. Kicker must be 5 yards from the
      line when they receive the snap.


      * Receiving team must have 4 players within one yard beyond the line of
      scrimmage until after the ball is kicked. No receiver can cross or move
      off the line of scrimmage until after the ball is kicked
  - title: Points
    text: >-
      * Touchdowns are 6 points.


      * Following a touchdown, an extra point can be made by converting a play
      from the 5 yard line or two extra points can be made by converting from
      the 10. Running is allowed on all extra point tries.


      * A team may change their decision on a 1-or 2-point try after using a
      team timeout.


      * If a team intercepts a pass or fumble during the try and returns it for
      a touchdown, the team scores 2 points.


      * During a try, after a change of possession, if a foul occurs that
      directly affects the runner (holding, personal foul, tripping), then the
      runner’s team shall be awarded an attempt to try for 2 points from the 10
      yard line.


      * During a try, after a change of possession, if there’s a foul that does
      not affect the runner, the penalty is assessed from the succeeding spot
      (the 15 yard line on the start of the next possession).
  - title: Highlighted Rule Clarifications
    text: >-
      * A player is not penalized for participating in a down without a flag
      belt. If a player is not wearing a flag belt at the snap, the ball becomes
      dead immediately if that player possesses the ball. If a player’s belt
      falls off during a play, a 1-hand touch is required to end the down.


      * Towels may be worn by the center only and must not interfere with the
      positioning of his / her flags.


      * If an illegal forward pass (ie, the QB throws the ball after crossing
      the line of scrimmage) occurs within 1 yard of the line of scrimmage, the
      penalty is 5 yards and a loss of down -- in this case, the QB will retain
      his run. However, if an illegal forward pass clearly occurs beyond 1 yard
      from the line of scrimmage, the same penalty applies AND the QB loses his
      run for that possession.


      * An errant snap that touches the ground is spotted at the previous spot
      and the down counts. In essence, it is treated as an incomplete pass.


      * A fumbled ball is dead once the ball touches the ground. If the ball is
      fumbled backwards, it is spotted where the ball touches the ground. If the
      ball is fumbled forward, it is spotted where the ball carrier lost
      possession. NOTE: an incomplete backwards pass is treated as a fumble and
      spotted where the ball touches the ground.


      * To ensure the game flows properly, after the score is announced by a
      referee, teams will have 15 seconds to choose between a one or a two point
      try. If the QB or captain has not stated the team's choice, the head
      referee will set the pucks for a 1 point try and start the play clock. If
      the offense wishes to change after the pucks are set, they must use a time
      out.


      * If a celebration violates the provisions described (directed at an
      opponent, crude, or sexually explicit), that is a 10 yard unsportsmanlike
      conduct penalty which the defense can choose to enforce on the extra point
      OR on the ensuing possession. Two unsportsmanlike conduct penalties in the
      same game by the same player will result in that player being ejected.
  - title: Personal Fouls
    text: >-
      The DCGFFL Board wants to reiterate League policy on personal fouls
      (unsportsmanlike conduct) to ensure the League remains a fun, safe, and
      harassment free environment in which to play football. 


      As outlined in the NGFFL rules, unsportsmanlike conduct includes:

      * Abusive, insulting, baiting or taunting language or gestures

      * Unnecessary roughness or overly physical conduct during or following a
      down

      * Spiking the ball or throwing the ball from the field of play

      * Insubordination towards a referee

      * Any other conduct deemed unsportsmanlike, dangerous, or unbecoming as
      determined by any referee of a given game


      Any player committing an act that the referee deems flagrant and
      semi-violent (such as throwing a ball at another player after play has
      ended) will be assigned a personal foul and will be automatically ejected
      for 8 downs / scrimmage plays. The player’s team will also receive a
      ten-yard penalty. (Note: Since a kickoff does not count as scrimmage play,
      an ejected player may participate in the kickoff at the start of a half.
      The kickoff does not account toward meeting the ejection period.)


      Violent personal fouls (such as throwing a punch) will result in automatic
      ejection for the remainder of the game and for the following game and will
      be reported to the Board for investigation and potentially further action.


      Any player who accrues two (2) or more personal fouls in one (1) game will
      be suspended automatically for the remainder of that game and for the
      following game that he or she would otherwise play. Any player who accrues
      three (3) or more personal fouls over the course of one (1) season may
      face a full season suspension.


      The DCGFFL Board reserves the right to review personal fouls and determine
      whether the severity of the foul and/or number of accumulated fouls merits
      disciplinary actions in addition to or separate from those listed above,
      including, but not limited to, partial or full suspension from future
      games or a full season suspension. Players and their team captains will be
      notified of personal fouls and any resulting disciplinary actions.
  - title: Suspensions
    text: >-
      If, in the judgment of the head referee, the conduct of a player violates
      the DCGFFL code of conduct and/or threatens the safety of a player or of
      the community, a head referee may enforce a suspension.


      1. LEVELS OF ENFORCEMENT


      Suspensions may vary based on the severity of the offense. Prior to
      issuing a suspension, the head referee may punish minor or initial
      offenses with a warning to the offending player and their captain or a
      personal foul penalty, as appropriate. 


      More serious or subsequent offenses may receive in-game suspensions not to
      exceed eight (8) plays. The most serious offenses—including any
      extracurricular offense that threatens the physical safety of a player or
      the community—may warrant an ejection and a formal suspension.


      Personal fouls that are determined, in the judgment of the head referee,
      to have been committed in bad faith, intentionally, or with the intent to
      harm or malign another member of the community, or that otherwise
      represent a serious violation of the DCGFFL code of conduct, shall merit
      suspension. Conduct that merits ejection from competition automatically
      earns a formal suspension, or a suspension for at least one full half of
      competition.


      When possible and appropriate, the head referee should begin with the
      lowest possible suspension appropriate for the offending behavior. For
      example, it may be appropriate for a head referee to issue a warning to
      the offending player and their captain, and then proceed to an in-game
      suspension before resorting to a formal suspension.


      2. DETERMINING FORMAL SUSPENSIONS


      The default duration for a formal suspension shall be one complete half of
      a game. 


      With suspensions for fouls that occur in the first half of a game, the
      offending player shall be disqualified in the first half and deemed
      suspended for the second half of the game; this player would be eligible
      to play in the following game. 


      With suspensions for fouls that occur in the second half of a game, the
      offending player shall be suspended for the first half of the next game
      for which the player is present.


      Additional suspension: Under extraordinary circumstances, in which the
      head referee, opposing captain, and Director of Players unanimously agree
      that additional suspension is merited, all parties must submit to the
      Board a written justification for additional suspension no later than the
      first Tuesday following the game. 



      Determination of additional suspension: Consistent with precedent, Members
      of the Board may  conduct an investigation and vote on what, if any,
      additional suspension should be enforced. A majority vote is required. 


      Recusals: No Board Member shall vote on an additional suspension if: (a)
      if the offending player is a member of the Board Member’s team; (b) the
      Board Member’s team will be playing the offending player in a game covered
      by a suspension; (c) the Board Member has a familial or romantic
      relationship with the offending player; (d) a Board Member determines that
      they cannot be impartial in the decision; or (e) the Board determines, by
      two-thirds vote, that a particular Board Member shall not participate in
      the vote.


      Further action: The Board reserves the right to investigate and pursue
      further action.


      The Director of Players shall communicate any discipline enforcement
      and/or discipline decisions made by the Board.


      4. PROGRESSIVE CONDUCT SUSPENSIONS


      Any player who accrues two (2) or more personal fouls for unsportsmanlike
      conduct in one (1) game will receive a formal suspension and will be
      ejected for the remainder of the game and, if the second penalty occurs in
      the second half, will be suspended automatically for the first half of the
      following game that they would otherwise play. Any player who accrues
      three (3) or more personal fouls over the course of one (1) season will be
      formally warned by the Director of Players that any additional personal
      fouls will result in a formal suspension of one complete game.
  - title: Policies - Play Every Play (PEP) Requirement
    text: >-
      During the regular season, captains are required to play every eligible
      and uninjured player for one drive in each half of a game, which can be on
      either offense or defense. Kickoffs do not count for purposes of
      fulfilling the PEP requirement.


      The DCGFFL Board reserves the right to review repeated infractions of this
      requirement by a captain and assign disciplinary action.
  - title: Policies - Player Playoffs Eligibility
    text: >-
      Players are required to play at least half (rounded up), or four (4)
      weeks, of their available games in a season in order to be eligible to
      play during the playoffs. Those starting at the beginning of the season
      need to play five (5) of the nine (9) season games, but those who join
      during the supplemental draft after Week 3 only need to meet half of their
      team’s remaining games (e.g. if the team has 5 remaining games, the player
      only needs to attend 3). Injury is the only exception to the game
      attendance requirement.
  - title: Policies - Playoffs Seeding
    text: >
      The Board will use the following methodology to determine playoffs
      seeding. This methodology is how the NGFFL seeds teams for Gay Bowl. The
      working modus is that win-loss ratios should be the deciding factor in
      determining rankings. Point spreads are only used if all sub-group
      analyses do not provide a winner:


      1) Overall Win-Loss Record: Within each conference, teams will be ranked
      highest to lowest according to most wins. Any cross-conference games
      played will count toward the overall record used for seeding.


      2) Ties: If two or more teams are tied with the same overall win-loss
      record, then ties will be broken using the following process:


      a) Head-to-Head Record between Two Teams - If two teams are tied with the
      same overall win-loss record, then the head-to-head record in the direct
      matchup will be used to determine the higher ranked team.


      b) Conference Record - If three or more teams are tied with the same
      overall win-loss record, then teams will be ranked highest to lowest
      according to most wins within the conference.


      c) Record amongst a Tied Group - If two or more teams are tied with the
      same conference record, then teams will be ranked highest to lowest
      according to most wins within the tied group.


      In the event that two teams are tied with the same conference record, the
      head-to-head record in the direct matchup will be used to determine the
      higher ranked team.


      In the event that three or more teams are tied with the same conference
      record, then teams will be ranked highest to lowest according to most wins
      within the tied sub-group. Sub-groups are analyzed as necessary.


      d) If teams are still tied after considering applicable sub-groups, then
      ranking is determined by the point differential within the sub group. If
      point differentials are the same, then expand to overall point
      differential. If still tied, then the tie is decided by a coin flip. The
      maximum point spread for any single game is ±36.
  - title: Policies - Playoffs Scheduling
    text: >-
      The DCGFFL uses a 20-team cross-conference bracket (see 'Sample Playoffs
      Bracket in the Important Information inset).


      1) Odd Seeds from one conference will be on one side of the bracket while
      Even Seeds are on the other side of the bracket. Except for #1 & #2 seeds,
      Odd Seeds of each conference will initially play Even Seeds from the other
      conference. Seeds #1 & #2 will play the winner of the Round 1 games.


      2) Byes: Seeds #1 through #6 of each conference have a single bye. Seeds
      #7 to #10 do not have a bye and may play a maximum of three games on the
      first weekend of playoffs.


      3) Round 1, Matchups:


      * Seeds #7 play #10 Seeds.

      * Seeds #8 play #9 Seeds.


      4) Round 1, Scheduling: The first round of games are played at either 8:00
      a.m. or 9:30 a.m. There are only two 8:00 a.m. games. Game times are
      assigned based on preference of the #1 or #2 seeds, who will play the
      winners in Round 2.


      5) Round 2, Matchups:


      * Seeds #1 play Winner of #8 v. #9 Round 1 Game.

      * Seeds #2 play Winner of #7 v. #10 Round 1 Game.

      * Seeds #3 play Seeds #6.

      * Seeds #4 play Seeds #5.


      6) Round 2, Scheduling: The second round of games may be played at 9:30
      a.m., 11:00 a.m., or 12:30 p.m. Two Round 2 games will be at 9:30, four at
      11:00, and 2 at 12:30 p.m.


      * The highest ranked #1 seed (W-L ratio, then total point differential) is
      given the first preference, followed by the #1 seed of the opposite
      conference. Preference is then give to the highest ranked #2 seed and so
      on until the schedule is set.

      * Teams may not have more than one back-to-back game.

      * Teams may not have more than one time period break in between games.

      * Captains are given the following options, which may determine the time
      of their game, their possible following game, or the prior game. Captains
      may only choose one option.


      i) Do you want to play as late as possible?

      ii) Do you want your potential opponent to play as early as possible?

      iii) Do you want to play back-to-back games, assuming you win?

      iv) Do you want your opponent to play back to back?

      v) Do you want a break between your games, assuming you win?

      vi) Do you want your opponents to have a break between their games?


      7) Quarterfinals, Matchups:


      * Winners of #1 v. #8 / #9 play Winners of #4 v. #5

      * Winners of #2 v. #7 / #10 play Winners of #3 v. #6


      8) Quarterfinals, Scheduling: The third round of games may be played at
      12:30 p.m., 2:00 p.m. Two Quarterfinal games will be at 12:30 and 2 at
      2:00 p.m. Timing may be determined by the timing of the Round 2 games.


      9) Championship Weekend: Semifinals and the Superbowl are on the final
      weekend of playoffs.


      * Semifinals: On each side of the bracket, the winners of the
      Quarterfinals will play each other in the Semifinals at 11:00 a.m.

      * Superbowl: The winner of each Semifinal will play in the Superbowl at
      1:00 p.m.
  - title: Football Size Requirements
    text: >-
      During an Open Division game, if a dual division player—meaning a player
      who is simultaneously enrolled in both the Open and Women’s+
      Divisions—plays at quarterback, the team captain may approach the head
      referee and request to replace the football that meets the requirements of
      NGFFL Rule 3.1.2.2 with a football that meets the requirements of NGFFL
      Rule 3.1.2.4. The referee shall make an announcement to both teams upon
      granting the captain’s request. At any time and at the discretion of the
      head referee, if granting this request is continually leading to a
      throwing advantage for a non-dual division player, the head ref may reject
      or revoke the captain’s request.
