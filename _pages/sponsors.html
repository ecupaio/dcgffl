      The league creates a sense of community for the players. Networking and
      socializing off the field is a core part of why many players joined the
      league, which means we are always looking for reasons and places to get
      together.

      This is where you come in. Whether it’s having a team dinner or watching
      our favorite sports, we’re loyal to our sponsors and eager to show our
      appreciation for the businesses that support us.

      will not only see your logo throughout the season, but also join us for
      post-game celebrations.
