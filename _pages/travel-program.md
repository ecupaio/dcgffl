### Thanks to all our 2022 Travel Players!

**Congratulations to the Commanders for bringing home a championship trophy from Pride Bowl!**

### About the Travel Program

The DCGFFL’s wealth of talent comes together annually to represent DC at two national tournaments — Pride Bowl (Chicago, early June) and Gay Bowl (annually rotating city, early fall).

In 2019 we fielded 1 women’s team (Senators in A division) and 4 Open Division teams (Generals in A division; Admirals in A division; Commanders in B division; and Delta Force in C division).  In 2021 we fielded 1 women's team (Senators) and 2 Open Division teams (Generals and Avengers \[pride bowl\] / Admirals \[gay bowl\]).  Each team is headed by a single captain, who selects the roster, manages the team, coordinates fundraising efforts, and makes sure the year runs smoothly for their travel team.

The Travel Program is managed by the Travel Management Committee (TMC) with oversight by the DCGFFL Board. The TMC is made up of one representatives from each active team, an independent administrator, and a liaison to the DCGFFL Board. Team representatives are chosen annually by the teams after the teams have been drafted, and the independent member is selected by a popular vote by anyone that registered for the current Travel season.

The 2023 Travel Committee is represented by the captains:

* Women's+ Senators Black - Nikki Kasparek
* Women's+ Senators Red - Nik Battaglia
* DC Elite - Open Division A - Jordan A.
* DC Admirals - Open Division A - Bryan Sanders
* DC Commanders - Open Divison B - Trey P.
* Open Division C - Vacant

Independent Member and Committee Chair – Kevin Smiffy  
DCGFFL Liaison – Patrick Barboun

Any questions on the travel program can be directed to the TMC at [DCGFFLTravel@gmail.com](mailto:DCGFFLTravel@gmail.com)
