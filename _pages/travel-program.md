### COVID-19 AND IMPACT TO TRAVEL TOURNAMENTS

First and foremost, we hope you and your loved ones are safe and healthy during these uncertain times. For many of us, the DCGFFL community is a family and a way for us to have fun and get a release from the stress of day to day life.  We’re eager to kick the momentum back up for 2021, and pick up right where we left off in 2019. Check back for updates on the status of this year’s tournaments.

### Save the date for this year’s travel tournaments:

[Pride Bowl XIII](https://www.facebook.com/PrideBowlChicago/) – June 27-28 in CHICAGO

[Gay Bowl XXI](https://youtu.be/l7WuqTrw97c) – October 7-10 (city TBD)

### About the Travel Program

The DCGFFL’s wealth of talent comes together annually to represent DC at two national tournaments — Pride Bowl (Chicago, early June) and Gay Bowl (annually rotating city, early fall). 2019 was a phenomenal year for the DCGFFL Travel Program, every single DC team made the semifinals at Gay Bowl and for the second year in a row, the Generals took home the championship! We are incredibly proud of all our players!

Every year, we send our athletes to two major flag football tournaments, Pride Bowl and Gay Bowl, to represent DC against other national teams. In 2019 we fielded 1 women’s team (Senators in A division) and 4 men’s teams (Generals in A division; Admirals in A division; Commanders in B division; and Delta Force in C division). Each team is headed by a single captain, who selects the roster, manages the team, coordinates fundraising efforts, and makes sure the year runs smoothly for their travel team.

The Travel Program is managed by the Travel Management Committee (TMC) with oversight by the DCGFFL Board. The TMC is made up of one representatives from each active team, an independent administrator, and a liaison to the DCGFFL Board. Team representatives are chosen annually by the teams after the teams have been drafted, and the independent member is selected by a popular vote by anyone that registered for the current Travel season.

In the transitional COVID-19 period, the Travel Committee is represented by the captains of the 2019 travel teams:

Senators – Jayme Fuglesten  
Generals – Marvin Washington    
Admirals – Bryan Sanders  
Commanders – Clay Arnold  
Delta Force – Dameron Rendell  

Independent Member and Committee Chair – JC Chiuco  
DCGFFL Liaison – Darryl Pilate
