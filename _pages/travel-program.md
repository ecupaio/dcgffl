### About the Travel Program

The DCGFFL’s wealth of talent comes together annually to represent DC at two national tournaments — Pride Bowl (Chicago, early June) and Gay Bowl (annually rotating city, early fall).

The Travel Program is managed by the Travel Management Committee (TMC) with oversight by the DCGFFL Board. The TMC is made up of one representatives from each active team, an independent administrator, and a liaison to the DCGFFL Board. Team representatives are chosen annually by the teams after the teams have been drafted, and the independent member is selected by a popular vote by anyone that registered for the current Travel season.

The 2025 Travel Committee is represented by the captains:

* Women’s+ Division A - Senators - Joey Cox
* Women’s+ Division B - Valkyries - Jillian Joyce
* Women’s+ Division C - Sirens - Tiff Yim
* Open Division A - Elite - Jordan Anderson
* Open Division A - Admirals - Alonzo M.
* Open Division B - Commanders - Trey Phillips
* Open Division C - Delta Force -  Jorge Membreño
* Open Division C/D - DC Freaky Boyz - Michael Zgoda

TMC Chair: Vincent Culliver<br>DCGFFL Board liaison: Brian Hotchkiss
