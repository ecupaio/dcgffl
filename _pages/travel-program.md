### About the Travel Program

The DCGFFL’s wealth of talent comes together annually to represent DC at two national tournaments — Pride Bowl (Chicago, early June) and Gay Bowl (annually rotating city, early fall). 2019 was a phenomenal year for the DCGFFL Travel Program, every single DC team made the semifinals at Gay Bowl and for the second year in a row, the Generals took home the championship! We are incredibly proud of all our players!

Every year, we send our athletes to two major flag football tournaments, Pride Bowl and Gay Bowl, to represent DC against other national teams. In 2019 we fielded 1 women’s team (Senators in A division) and 4 Open Division teams (Generals in A division; Admirals in A division; Commanders in B division; and Delta Force in C division). Each team is headed by a single captain, who selects the roster, manages the team, coordinates fundraising efforts, and makes sure the year runs smoothly for their travel team.

The Travel Program is managed by the Travel Management Committee (TMC) with oversight by the DCGFFL Board. The TMC is made up of one representatives from each active team, an independent administrator, and a liaison to the DCGFFL Board. Team representatives are chosen annually by the teams after the teams have been drafted, and the independent member is selected by a popular vote by anyone that registered for the current Travel season.

In the transitional COVID-19 period, the Travel Committee is represented by the captains of the 2019 travel teams:

Senators – Jayme Fuglesten  
Generals – Marvin Washington  
Admirals – Bryan Sanders  
Commanders – Clay Arnold  
Delta Force – Dameron Rendell

Independent Member and Committee Chair – JC Chiuco  
DCGFFL Liaison – Ryan Viessman
