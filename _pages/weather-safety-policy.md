All participants of the DCGFFL are expected to work together and abide by CDC guidelines to ensure a safe environment for playing flag football.  On registration, participants will be required to sign an agreement and release waiver to comply with these policies at all times during league events.  Participants should also understand that these protocols are subject to change based on local, federal, and CDC requirements.

#### Vaccination

All Players, Officials, and Spectators who are able to do so are expected to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19, in accordance with CDC guidelines. Proof of vaccination will not be required for participation in DCGFFL, but being vaccinated is the best way to make our league as safe as possible. As of March 5, 2022, many of our sponsors require proof of vaccination to enter; this includes venues that will be hosting DCGFFL events throughout the season. Thus, individuals are expected to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 in order to fully participate in this seasonâ€™s events.

#### Face Coverings

Per CDC and local guidelines, masks will not be required for outdoor activities. DC guidelines currently require face coverings be worn inside bars and restaurants, including sponsor venues that will be hosting DCGFFL events. Any participants who may choose to still wear masks at outdoor events are welcome to do so, at their option.

#### Equipment

Teams are required to bring their own game balls. At the beginning of the season, Captains will be given team bags that include flag belts. Flag belts must not be shared with other teams.

#### COVID-19 Exposure and Notification

If a participant tests positive for COVID-19, we encourage them to notify us as soon as possible by emailing dcgayflagfootball@gmail.com or contacting a board member. All personal information will be kept confidential. DCGFFL will abide by all local and Federal guidelines, in the event we receive a report of a participant testing positive. This includes, but is not limited to: Contacting all participants with potential contact with the COVID-positive participant(s).

These guidelines are subject to change based on local, federal, and CDC requirements.
