    - title: Captains and QBs
      text: >-
        Captains are selected from veterans of the regular league. Previous
        captaining experience is not required.


        Each team has one or two QBs.  One QB may be a veteran QB who is or has
        QB’d in the regular league. This gives Rec players more consistent
        throws and play calling. The second QB is one who would like to QB for
        the regular league or would just like to try his or her hand at running
        an offense. Quarterbacks will switch every offensive series or half or
        as decided by the captains and QBs. However, secondary QBs must play at
        least one half if present.
    - title: Restricted Players
      text: >-
        Highly skilled players (e.g. travel team players or consistent MVP
        recipients) may be restricted at the captains’ discretion. These players
        will be denoted on the team rosters with bold and are limited in the
        following ways:


        1. They cannot play their normal offensive and/or defensive position.

        2. They may catch or intercept the ball, but they cannot advance it.


        Generally, these are players on a travel team or those who consistently
        obtain MVPs in the regular season.


        The mission is to make the Recreation League a place where everyone has
        the chance to participate on both offense and defense.
