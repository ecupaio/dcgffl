    The DCGFFL features two divisions: The Open Division and the Women's+
    Division. Both divisions are welcoming to individuals of all skill levels,
    from seasoned players to those new to football. Furthermore, it provides a
    fellowship for both LGBTQ+ individuals and straight allies alike. We invite
    you to attend our games, meet incredible individuals, and contemplate
    becoming a part of our team as a player!
