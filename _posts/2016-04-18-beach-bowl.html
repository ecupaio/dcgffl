<p><strong><em>Let's go to the beach, each! Let's go get away!</em></strong></p>
<p>The DCGFFL's annual Beach Bowl will be July 30th in Rehoboth!  Begin making your housing arrangements now because motels, houses, and the bed of last year's summer hookup may be full if you wait too long.</p>
<p>We'll play games in the morning and afternoon, followed by a pool party and cookout.  DCGFFL will provide transportation from the main drag in Rehoboth to the pool party.  Details about registration and fees to be announced in June.</p>
<p><strong><em>Let's do this one more time!</em></strong></p>
