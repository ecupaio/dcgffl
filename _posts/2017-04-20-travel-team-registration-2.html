<p>The 2017 travel season is here!</p>
<p>Once again, the DCGFFL's wealth of talent will come together to represent Washington at two national tournaments -- Pride Bowl X in Chicago (June 23-24) and Gay Bowl XVII in Boston (October 5-8).</p>
<p>In the Men's A-Division, our city will be represented by the Washington Generals, DC Admirals, and DC Commanders. In the Men's B-Division, DC Delta Force will once again look to dominate the competition. And in the Women's Division, the Washington Senators will look to bring home a championship at Gay Bowl.</p>
<p>This year, the DC Travel Program has also made some exciting changes to help enhance roster continuity and player choice. We've added new rules, including the idea of "franchise" tags for players, that will strengthen team cohesiveness and increase the rights of individual players.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/YPVHKQ2">It's going to be an exciting travel season! And, if you think you have what it takes to represent our city and help us bring home a championship, you can register here.</a></p>
<p>Don't delay! <b>Registration ends on Monday, April 24th at 5pm</b>.</p>
<p>The captains will host one tryout (not mandatory, but encouraged):</p>
<p><b>Sunday, April 23rd at 2:30pm</b> (after the League's games at Carter Barron, 16th &amp; Kennedy NW)</p>
<p>The Draft will take place the following weekend April 28-30.</p>
<p>If you have questions, please contact the unaffiliated members of the Travel Working Group: Brett Chambers (<a href="mailto:footballbrettchambers@gmail.com" target="_blank">footballbrettchambers@gmail.<wbr />com</a>), Bobby Bosfield (<a href="mailto:rbosfield@gmail.com" target="_blank">rbosfield@gmail.com</a>) and Javi de Diego (<a href="mailto:javi.dediego@gmail.com" target="_blank">javi.dediego@gmail.com</a>).</p>
<p><i>NOTE: The Senators will be holding their tryouts and draft in June, because they will not be participating in Pride Bowl.</i></p>
