Congratulations to all of our players on the [Washington Senators](https://dcgffl.us16.list-manage.com/track/click?u=44f118b44c71d10ae3076bec3&id=0f3f52eb29&e=99572f36a5), [DC Admirals](https://dcgffl.us16.list-manage.com/track/click?u=44f118b44c71d10ae3076bec3&id=a7dcb1985a&e=99572f36a5), [Washington Generals](https://dcgffl.us16.list-manage.com/track/click?u=44f118b44c71d10ae3076bec3&id=87a860aeb1&e=99572f36a5), [DC Commanders](https://dcgffl.us16.list-manage.com/track/click?u=44f118b44c71d10ae3076bec3&id=20f8cca6fa&e=99572f36a5), [Delta Force](https://dcgffl.us16.list-manage.com/track/click?u=44f118b44c71d10ae3076bec3&id=8661cbedeb&e=99572f36a5). You all represented us well this weekend, and we're proud of you!

In addition, the Generals brought home the championship trophy. The Generals went undefeated in pool play, earning the 3rd seed and a first-round bye heading into elimination play. In their first elimination game, the Generals slipped past New York Warriors Black, Gay Bowl's defending champions. In the semifinals, the G5 defeated the recent Pride Bowl champions (LA Express Stars,) by five points. They then dominated the championship game 29-13 versus the San Diego Toros.

We want to give a special shout out to Donald Mitchell on leading this team to victory in his inaugural season as captain. We also want to congratulate Mark Summerside and Jeremy Steslicki on earning tournament defensive and offensive MVPs, respectively. And finally to Pearce, Brandon, Barry, Earl, Santos, the Phams, Billy, OJ, Evan, Miles, Marvin, John, and Bradley, we're extremely proud of you! Your skill and hard work earned DC players their first Gay Bowl championship since 2004.
