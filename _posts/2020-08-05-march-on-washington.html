<p>The DCGFFL continues to look for ways to support and stand with our Black members, friends, families, supporters and allies. We support calls to action to march and peacefully protest for equality and justice. And with league members, past and present, working and demonstrating for equality, we express our support for Black Lives Matter. For this reason, we created a space for community members to march in solidarity during the March on Washington on August 28th.  </p>

<p>On August 28, 1963, about a quarter-million people participated in the historic March on Washington gathering near the Lincoln Memorial in which Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. delivered the historic  “I Have a Dream” speech.  On August 28th, 2020, we honored the memories of all the civil rights activists that came before us, and carried their dreams forward.</p>
