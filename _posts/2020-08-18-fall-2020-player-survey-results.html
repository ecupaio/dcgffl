<p>Thanks for your responses!  There are a lot of things to consider for whether flag football can be played in the near or middle term - local phasing and the health and safety of our players coming first and foremost - but it is also important to hear what YOU have to say.Â  Summary info in this presentation is provided to the community for your mutual awareness.</p>
