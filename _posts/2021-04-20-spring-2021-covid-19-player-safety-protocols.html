<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The DCGFFL has developed COVID-19 Player Safety Protocols based on CDC guidelines and the positive experiences of the New York and Denver gay flag football leagues in Fall 2020.&nbsp; Players will be required to comply with these player safety protocols and will sign a statement and waiver to that effect.</p>
