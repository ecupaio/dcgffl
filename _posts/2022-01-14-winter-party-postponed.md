Our 2022 Winter Party (Registration Launch for Season XXII) has been rescheduled to Thursday, February 3, at Red Bear Brewing Co., from 7 PM to close. Red Bear Brewing Co. is located at 209 M St NE, Washington, DC 20002.  
  
Come to hang with your league mates, catch up with old teammates, and meet potential leaguers! As an incentive, a season XXI team that has the most members present will receive a free round of drinks!  
  
Have a friend who might be interested in joining? Bring them! Any leaguer who gets the most new players to register at the event will win a gift card ðŸ’¸!
