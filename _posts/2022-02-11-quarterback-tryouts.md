If you registered as a prospective quarterback and have not previously played quarterback during a regular season of the DCGFFL, you're required to attend a QB tryout to be eligible for selection as QB.

With a 50/50 chance of accumulating snow on Sunday morning, we decided to offer two opportunities for new quarterbacks to try out this weekend:

* **QB Tryout Option #1 - Saturday, February 12th at 1 PM at Edgewood Recreation Center turf field (300 Evarts St. NE, Washington, DC 20002)**
* **QB Tryout Option #2 - Sunday, February 13th at 1 PM at Carter Barron Soccer Fields (1698 Kennedy St NW, Washington, DC 20011)**

Registered prospective QBs are required to attend at least one of the tryouts.  **We expect to have much better weather conditions on Saturday (62 degrees and sunny!) so we recommend you join then if you are able!**

Come prepared to demonstrate your ability to:

• throw quick, accurate passes to receivers running routes  
• select and communicate play calls  
• manage a huddle and individual player assignments
