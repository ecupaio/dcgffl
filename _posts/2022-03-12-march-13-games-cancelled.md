You may bring food from El Rey into TDG to eat.

#### **How will this affect the schedule?**

In coordination with team captains, the Board considered various options to adjust the schedule as a result of the cancellation.  [**The updated schedule can be viewed here! **](/s22-schedule-rev/)

The Week 1 games were rescheduled as a second doubleheader for each team, while largely preserving the rest of the schedule.  All rescheduled games are noted in bold and italicized text on the schedule.

#### **Field Conditions**

Here's a look at the frozen fields.  Stay warm today!  Warmer weather is on the way soon!
