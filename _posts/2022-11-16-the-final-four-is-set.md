What a day of games!  Plenty of tight matchups and close battles (including two overtime games!) in the single elimination tournament!  Now, it's all down to Black, Red, Coral, and still undefeated Iron Grey.  They'll meet on **Sunday, November 20th for the semifinals (10 AM) and super bowl (12 PM)!**

Come one, come all to watch the final Season 23 showdown this Sunday at Carter Barron -- the cold never bothered us anyway!

Following games, we invite all league members to attend our End of Season Party from 3pm-7pm at Kiki. Come celebrate another great season, our eventual champions, and this season's award winners!
