Registration for the Fall 2025 season is now open! Here’s what you need to know.<br><br>**Are you a returning player?**

* You can sign up as early as Monday, July 28! Early registration opens at 7:00pm and is available to the first 100 players for the Open Division and the first 50 players in the Women’s+ Division.
* As a bonus, if you sign up early, you will receive **free DCGFFL branded flags**! While supplies last.

<br>**Are you a new player?**

* Create your profile on Team Arrange using [this link](https://dcgffl.us16.list-manage.com/track/click?u=44f118b44c71d10ae3076bec3&amp;id=a8504dad11&amp;e=6f9cd00365){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, and enter code “DCGFFL” if prompted. Then wait for Thursday July 31 when registration opens for everyone!
* Make sure you register for one of the New Player Workshops—any player who has not played in the DCGFFL before must complete a New Player Workshop to learn the rules of the game and get to meet the team leaders who you will play with!
* If you are unable to make the scheduled New Player Workshops on August 21 or 23, please email the League at [dcgayflagfootball@gmail.com](mailto:dcgayflagfootball@gmail.com){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

**How much does it cost?**

* Fees for this season are $85 for returning players, $100 for new players, and $110 for players who register for both the Open and Women’s+ Divisions.
