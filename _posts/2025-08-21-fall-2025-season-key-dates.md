Get out your calendars and make sure you take note of all the key dates for the fall season. Here are some changes:

* **No Double Headers:** We are continuing the trial for seasons without double headers! But this year, we are returning to a 9-game schedule to get you even more football.
* **9-Week Regular Season:** The calendar this year allows us to fit in one game a week over an extended regular season.
* **One bye week:** Instead of two bye weeks, we are only scheduling one to allow our travel teams to compete at Gay Bowl. That means more weeks of football and more Sunday fundays for you!
