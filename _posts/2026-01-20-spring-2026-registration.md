Registration for the Spring 2026 season opens on Monday, January 26th for returning players and January 27th for new players! Here’s what you need to know.<br><br>**Are you a returning player?**

* You can sign up as early as Monday, January 26! Early registration opens at 7:00pm and is available to the first 100 players for the Open Division and the first 66 players in the Women’s+ Division.

**Are you a new player?**

* Create your profile on Team Arrange using [this link](https://teamarrange.com/Account/Register?code=dcgffl){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, and enter code “DCGFFL” if prompted. Then wait for Tuesday, January 27th at 7pm when registration opens for everyone!
* Make sure you attend one of the New Player Workshops. Any player who has not played in the DCGFFL before must complete a New Player Workshop to learn the rules of the game and get to meet the team leaders who you will play with!
* If you are unable to make the scheduled New Player Workshops on February 8th or 9th, please email the League at [dcgayflagfootball@gmail.com](mailto:dcgayflagfootball@gmail.com){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

**How much does it cost?**

* Fees for this season are $85 for returning players, $100 for new players, and $100 for players who dual-register to play in both the Open and Women’s+ Divisions.
* Note: Team Arrange lists the cost as $100. The returning player discount will be applied at checkout—fear not, veterans!
