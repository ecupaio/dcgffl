  Welcome to Week Two! The unofficial kickoff of the season saw clear skies,
  full hearts, and lots of injuries. I missed dragging you alleged athletes on
  the field and with my extra fine ballpoint Swarovski pen. This week, Ed is
  joining the dark side to help throw some extra shade. Let’s get into it.   By:

      The Hot Ones are on Cloud Nine after multiple decisive victories, despite
      Captain Lamar suffering a harrowing knee injury that halted his
      high-flying heroics. But I'd like to take a moment to do what I do best
      and play the victim card. Cameron stopped me from landing a touchdown
      after I executed a stellar breakaway play with both sex appeal AND perfect
      form. Screw running the clock, you ruined my moment!


      Will the Cardinals continue soaring to the championships, or will bad
      knees and stolen spotlights clip our wings?

      I never understood why so many people refuse to Neon My Face, but I guess
      they have Urine Trouble. Anyway, this team proved that it has great aim
      and a future full of golden showers after squeezing out every drop and
      clinching two hard-fought Ws. I’m excited to see where Neon My Face goes
      next — after all, there are so many options: Neon My Mouth, Neon My
      Eyes…keep winning like this, and you can Neon My Everywhere!

      There's certainly no skimming over the massive victory Field of Creams
      churned out this weekend, proving they're truly among the cream of the
      crop. Opponents, beware: These rushers are willing to whip their opponents
      into shape, like cream into butter - just ask Hotchkiss, who took a brutal
      punching like a big ol' sundae surprise!

      You Got Moss'd showed the Pink Pony Club who's the real stallion after
      they left their opponents grazing in the shadows of a 40+ point game. This
      team has a formidable mix of veterans who can mow the lawn with their
      enemies, and rookies who may be quick to sprout into star players. With
      their mane-taming maneuvers and hoof-stomping touchdowns, You Got Moss'd
      proved they're not just horsing around on the field; they're galloping
      towards victory.

      If only a punny name alone could get you in the top four, this team would
      be cashing in on a championship victory. Still, you still managed to put
      Team Atomic in a nearly bombed out mercy zone during an exciting 24-6
      game, proving you’re willing to do what it takes to get your money’s
      worth. I’d give you a tip, but I don’t donate to charity.

      These Blacked Out Barbies cast dark clouds over their Light Blue opponents
      during a close match — then, true to form, got blacked out at Sunday
      Funday. If Grey 4 Pay has the punniest team name, yours is the most
      derivative. If this team can avoid the 8AM jello shots and never-ending
      Saturday bar crawls they may have a chance to climb up in the rankings.

      Despite claiming a victory from this week’s game, Royal Blue sees its rank
      drop several positions from their previous height in the preseason
      rankings. Although JC found exceptional receivers in both Jeremy and
      Oliver, we didn’t expect such a royally tight point spread against the
      bottom-ranked and short-handed Bellagi-hos. If he’s to continue his
      dynasty, reigning King JC is going to have to round up the knights of his
      table and prove once and for all that they’ve earned the status of
      royalty.

      Urine Trouble found themselves in a stream of defeat after My Little
      Foamies bubbled over with success. Yellow was in hot water after the
      Foamies turned the tides and floated to victory, a nice triumph that just
      gave me at least three more easy piss puns.

      <br>Lime Green had a hell of a week, losing by just a single point to one
      of the top-ranking teams at the 9am time slot. Despite starting out slow,
      lime shocked everyone by clinching a decisive victory over the equally
      competitive purple team in the afternoon game. We know with the right
      amount of teamwork, and maybe a little bit of luck, this citrus team might
      just find themselves chasing celebratory shots of salt and tequila next
      Sunday.

      Grape Sexpectations may have won this match, but they didn’t exactly crush
      their opponents, and while they may have fermented a win, I was left
      wanting a sweeter taste of victory. Here's hoping these grapes don't go
      sour. (Look, with 18 teams, unfortunately some of these are going to be
      called in. We have full-time jobs.)

      Even though they lost their season opener, the Vegas Bellagi-hos may have
      struck gold with this overlooked band of misfits. With Clem gone, Dre
      stepped up and showed everyone just how versatile a straight man in a crop
      top can be. Against top-ranked Royal, and despite low turn-out, this Los
      Vegas residency gave everyone a very real glimpse of star power.

      The Blue Bombers got a bit defused by the Blacked Out Barbies after they
      had their lights dimmed during a dark match. Left in the shadows of
      defeat, these bombers will have to dig themselves out of their broken
      barracks and claw their way back from the trenches.

      What to say about this group of size queens? My husband’s leg basically
      fell off during this game, nearly sending me into my widow era (I have an
      entire section of my closet ready for the moment) and yet we still won.
      Aubrie played 14 games of football for breakfast and STILL ate y’all up
      like it was nothing. I fear we left no crumbs. Also, your name is as
      questionable as your playing on the field.

      I have so much affection for all of the beautiful ponies in this club, but
      unfortunately today the stable needs a bit of tough love. I was rooting
      for you - we were all rooting for you! - but your prance through a field
      of flowers turned into a field of the moss't upsetting touchdowns. Even
      with all your star-studded horsepower, you couldn't notch a win this week.

      This band of misfits stayed true to its name with a disjointed and
      discombobulated performance on the field. The Atoms Family bombed their
      shot of a victory, only securing a singular touchdown against darker,
      greyer forces.

      Looks like Team Olive is gonna be starting out this season in the pit.
      Despite having a team with great depth and seemingly unlimited raw
      potential, virgin Captain Juan V. doesn’t quite seem to have olive his
      ducks in order just yet. However, we’re convinced that with just a little
      bit of magic this team might yet find the pot of gold at the end of the
      rainbow.

      I don’t know what’s more surprising: The fact that Logan allowed this team
      name to get approved, or how incredibly poor your performance was this
      week. They say the whoral reefs are dying all over the world. You gave us
      no hope that a miraculous rebirthing era is about to begin.

      Unfortunately, Urine Trouble seemed to have lived up to its name this
      week, with a performance many would call…piss poor. While they didn’t put
      up any Wins, they sure put up a good ol’ Irish fight, with relatively
      close games for starting at such a wee hour. Suffice it to say, the Saint
      Paddys day bar crawl the day before may have taken its toll, with a
      confidential source close to one of the players telling us “My shower this
      morning from *\*\*redacted\*\** was just a few shades darker than normal.”
