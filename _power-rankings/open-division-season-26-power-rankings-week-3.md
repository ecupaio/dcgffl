  Obie McNair: Whew! After this week’s games, I don’t know if I was watching
  football or an episode of the Real Housewives.    🤔But you know what, that
  may be a good idea for a theme for this week’s rankings. So without further
  ado, let’s see how the teams rank and which housewife they’re currently
  associated with. (And for you “I don’t watch Housewives” gurls… 😑this may be
  a good reason to watch an episode or 5! lol)

      More like “Neon My Haters!” I must say, to play both double header
      weekends back-to-back and still come out with an undefeated record, is
      quite a feat! Not to mention it seems that Sean Holihan has had quite the
      breakout performance this season…are we seeing the beginnings of a new
      Nene Leakes in this league?!

      Well…the good news is this team played an excellent game against Seafoam
      with Jeremy and Oliver battling to become JC’s Next Top Receiver. But as
      for the bad news…If I had my Sunday Funday delayed only to be told that
      Forest forfeited when I could have been 5 mimosas in by now, yeah that may
      have also put me in a RHONJ’s Teresa Giudice mood as well!

      You know what I love about this team…they’re never in the drama. They come
      in, handle their business and go on with their days. Which is exactly what
      they did on Sunday, completely annihilating Atomic. We shall see how long
      this last, but as for right now, this team is in their RHOA’s Kandi
      Burress “Fly Above It” era

      Similar to White, they are a get business done team! I mean you got
      Dwaylen with 2 sacks, Aaron with a sack, even Travis scoring an extra
      point against a pretty well stacked Cardinal (*minus Lamar…but we’ll get
      there in sec* 😉). But if I know my sister Aaron well, there’s always
      something cooking behind those eyes, very much so like RHOBH’s infamous
      LVP!!!

      There’s an old trick that Housewives love to do when ratings go down on a
      show…***Bring back an old head*** & looks like Lime has been studying this
      show! Down after the first half, QB Ben Hunt took control of the reigns
      and with the help of Nick and Tom, brought the team back into the
      spotlight! Listen, only a few of y’all Heteros can pull off the Bethanny
      Frankel of RHONY and do it flawlessly! Kudos to you Ben!

      If there is one thing, my mom always taught me is, “Always let your
      actions speak louder than your words!”. Purple definitely lives up to this
      mantra, you won't hear much about them, but their playtime lets you know
      how good of a team they are. Getting out to a 20-7 lead at halftime, only
      to stay on the gas and end the game 33-15. In a similar fashion, quiet
      housewives often are the ones that people don’t realize can shake a table
      and Meghan King on RHOC was definitely one of those girls!

      *\*\*Sigh*\*\* Injuries are never fun, and this team is experiencing this
      first hand. With captain Lamar potentially out for the season, looks like
      hubby Chris and the team is stepping up to pick up the slack, with an
      impressive 3 sacks to take the win in the “Reigning Sack Queen”
      competition. But with all this on his shoulders, will the weight of it all
      begin to take a toll as it did with RHOBH’s Erika Jayne?!

      Well let’s start with the good… a pretty decisive win over Vegas Gold with
      Fernando earning MVP honors! It’s a shame that this win was followed by a
      forfeit against Royal Blue. It is clear to me that this team is currently
      is their RHOA - Season 6 Porsha Williams era…But if this is true to form,
      they’re gonna come back in true middle peach form!

      9th place…middle of the pack…its giving forgettable! That’s how the season
      is starting out for you Seafoam (I literally almost forgot to write
      something about yall). I do know you ended last sunday with a loss to
      Royal, but there wasn’t even really any standout plays from the game!


      When y’all play Forest in two weeks, I need y’all to come out of your
      shell and perform. Make us ***FOAM*** at the mouth…otherwise you’re gonna
      be like those DC Housewives, not talked about!


      …and since I couldn’t even find a GIF of them, you guys get lil Gia
      expressing my thoughts!

      Let this week, be a valuable lesson for all teams out there!
      ***<u>NEVER</u> get too comfortable!*** Looking at this scorecard, it is
      clear that this team got relaxed in the 2nd half and that’s when Lime came
      alive! Interesting enough, a certain local housewife here in Potomac is
      also learning this same lesson right now.

      Guess we will have to see if Black and Gizelle Bryant can get back to
      their top spots! Only time will tell.

      Now as a point of personal privilege, as a previous donner of this color
      team (*that just so happened to be the runner-ups last season* 😜) I
      definitely have a soft spot for the team. So I’m glad to see that they
      have turned it around after a 0-2 start last week with a win against
      Marine. It may only be week 2, but I know that with Derrick at the helm,
      this team is definitely gonna turn it up as the season goes on…just like
      my favorite housewife from Miami, Marysol Patton!

      If there is one thing I love its a comeback story, and Atomic has all the
      makings of it! I mean, they got knocked down badly in their first game
      against White. But they dusted themselves off, made some rearrangements,
      and were able to pull out a win against Light Blue!!! It’s giving their
      Sophomore season rise, very much so like Lisa Barlow did on RHOSLC.

      Well with strong veteran leadership this team is off to a fairly decent
      start. They had a great win over Olive in the morning, before losing a
      nail-biter to Atomic in the afternoon. But it seems like Adam S. may have
      ruffled a feather or two of Atomic’s during that game. But thankfully Luis
      was there to keep things classy, because like the Countess Luann from
      RHONY always says…

      Ahh…my turn up team! If this team is gonna do one thing is brunch and have
      a good time. I just need them to bring that same turn up energy to the
      field, cuz 2 sacks and a scoreless 2nd half is not the look of a winning
      team. But if the brunch turn-up was anything like the folks said it was,
      y’all for sure were giving RHONY’s Dorinda Medley vibes!!!

      You know you’re an OG when the league has a saying about you, and this
      week, Jim definitely lived up to the saying “Trainwreck is gonna
      Trainwreck”. 3 INT against Neon Orange is not a good look, but listen as
      the Vicki Gunvalson of DCGFFL, I think he’s earned the right to have a bad
      game…😕or two! **<u>BUT THAT’S ALL YOU GET!!!</u>**

      “Tick…tock…tick…tock” Sorry, that’s the sound of my clock as I look for
      this team to get it together. I’m sorry, but with a veteran QB in
      Hotchkiss, a reigning Sunshine All-Team member in Juan as Captain, and a
      pretty athletic roster, no reason why yall shouldn’t be 2-0!!! But a
      blowout loss in Week 1 and a follow-up loss to Light Blue isn’t giving me
      much confidence. You guys are giving me Dallas housewife LeeAnne Locken
      cuz I really want to root for y’all!!!

      Now Gold, I have to hold your feet to the fire as well…cuz y’all are too
      talented of a team to be behind the entire game against Forest. It also
      doesn’t help that you followed up with a loss to Neon Orange later on that
      day. But at least in that game y'all showed you ain’t no punks! Very much
      so Potomac’s Candiace Dillard teas!!!

      I hate to say it, but this team is truly living their name, cuz baby, You
      guys are in trouble! It’s hard to figure out why this team is at the
      bottom of the pack. Watching them play, it’s definitely not because of a
      lack of talent nor is it lack of heart. My hope is that they can figure it
      out and get on the right side of things in the end. But the sad reality is
      sometimes, the team just doesn’t work out…just like sometimes a housewife
      really isn’t fit for a show. I think Kim Fields learn that the hard way on
      RHOA.
