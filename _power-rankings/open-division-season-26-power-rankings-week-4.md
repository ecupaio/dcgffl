      It was a battle Royale with Neon Orange, but in the end there could be
      only one Queen Bey, and one fungible KellyMichelle getting waved offstage
      at will. Royal capitalized on an INT by retirement community water
      aerobics instructor Steslicki, and JC demonstrated that he can actually
      tell time with strong clock management at the end. (Despite this
      revelation, he still will fail to show up to literally anything on time).


      This crew is the only undefeated team left in the league; will all the top
      hits they're dropping result in this team winning Album of the Year, or
      will they ultimately be snubbed at the end by another contender? DCGFFL,
      imma let you finish.

      You played a great game, but a W this week just wasn’t your destiny,
      child. Even though this week you were Effie White to Royal’s Deena Jones,
      we know you’re Not Going, no way. Shoutout to Joshy walking into Shakers
      like nobody’s business with 3 TDs and a ruddy (being charitable)
      complexion afterwards.


      In other news: local ophthalmologists are reported to be dealing with a
      sudden influx of patients with burnt retinas due to staring too long
      directly at … Sanders’ quick drag.<br>

      These barbies were feelin’ themselves (myself) this weekend - snatching
      two hard-fought wins this weekend. I thought that twink privilege was SO
      2018 but apparently these girls never got the message, proving that pretty
      does not *in fact* hurt with a core of several fast twink receivers.


      Most (or rather, not at all) incredibly, shoutout to Jay for getting
      points on the board after getting us all Crazy in Love on Saturday! We
      want to see it two, three times in a row.

      their top spots! Only time will tell.

      Remember those walls this team built by forfeiting last week? Baby,
      they’re tumbling down. They didn’t even put up a fight (this weekend),
      they didn’t even make a sound (for now). They just won. And we love to see
      AJ spreading the ball around – maybe some (daddy) lessons are being
      learned!

      This team led by hella thotty, seasoned professional str8s\* was kinda
      sorta I guess in the mood to f\* something up, barely eking out a W over
      very mellow Yellow. Lime, we suppose you can come and cuff it; we hope the
      juice was worth the squeeze.

      If you thought this team wouldn't be able to do much without their Becky
      with the good hair QB, you'd be wrong. Rookie Shawn proved they could have
      another QB in a minute, only losing to the Hot Ones in a nailbiter game.
      While you're off gallivanting around the Louvre or whatever Oriya, better
      not get to thinking you're irreplaceable.

      Do you know these Greys? They didn’t have much to say to the press about
      their loss this week, with Matt H. only offering the insights that Light
      Blue “played football today” and “BB is not injured,” and Aaron S. giving
      an uncharacteristically staid rundown of a “kinda anticlimactic” game.
      Which, I suppose, is basically Bey’s media strategy, so you’ve got us
      there.

      My Hot Ones! Our hive is still looking a tad dissheveled after our own
      Queen Bee Lamar was officially benched for the season. It looks like she
      and the rest of us (incl. Carlos’ poor pup) could’ve taken Bey’s advice
      Don’t Hurt Yourself this week. We played our hearts out and caught some
      bad breaks, but ending 1-1 on this Sunday's matchups wasn't exactly much
      to write home to Tina about. Do we need even more hot sauce in our bag?
      Let’s regroup, come back next week in Formation, and we’ll paint the town
      red like cinnamon.

      It's two for the pink! This team pulled out a set of twin wins that would
      have made mama Bey proud (wly too Blue). With Cam B putting up some big
      stats, including a kickoff runback, Justin reminding he's more than just a
      trophy husband/captain and is a playmaker in his own right, and Brandon G
      being sack city, watch out: this team is poised to paint the world
      \[redacted\] pink.

      Rumor has it that well past the matronly Brenda Over’s bedtime on
      Saturday, 11:30 found her Jumpin Jumpin at Bunker. Whether it was the
      spirits of her apparent drag inspirations Mmes. Kasha Davis and Doubtfire,
      Carrie Underwood at her whiskey shooting finest, or Queen Bey herself
      guiding her, we can't say. All we know is by Sunday morning, Brenda was
      replaced with a pockets full grown QB who led his team to a W over some
      competitive Greys (at least for pay).

      Hotchkiss has got her Virgins’ Groove back and is looking comfortable in
      her (pig)skin. This team came out looking refreshed, moisturized, and
      rejuvenated by the pickup of young Johnny in Supplemental, pulling out an
      underdog win over the Hot Ones and a … regular win over Coral. It’s giving
      no longer virgin, and all back of the limousine, riding with that
      surfboard. It might even be a Summer Renaissance.

      Grape’s sweet dream became a beautiful nightmare this weekend after losing
      to previously winless Pink - slowly watching the scoreboard go up almost
      as many times as Love on Top has key changes. Either way, not quite the
      birthday present Connor was hoping for.


      To add insult to injury, one of their TDs was entirely because three Pink
      rookies didn’t know what to do when Shaq’s flags fell off mid-play. Hint:
      even if he’s a mastermind in haute couture, he’s NOT too classy to be
      touched.

      These lil Foamies started off the season with a lil win, but just haven’t
      found their inner stallions in the weeks since. But I’m telling everybody,
      this author does feel sympathy for them: they have a whopping FIVE 9am
      games this season, and Bey taught us about the injustice of being at work
      by 9. Maybe once they sleep real good at night, they’ll be queens in the
      frontfield, doms in the backfield.

      This team should have left their phone at home cause this was a disaster.
      After a strong first half, including rookie Shawn securing his first TD on
      his very first game (take notes ladies), this team fell apart after their
      captain bobbled the ball directly into the other team’s hands on the first
      play of the second half - goddess only knows why. While they put up a good
      fight, they were playing catch up the rest of the game and couldn’t quite
      close it out in time.


      Cut to image of Tiger sitting alone, playing Pray You Catch Me in his car
      after the game.

      In the darkest night hour, we searched through the crowd – and very few
      people had anything to say about the pee team. But we love them like XO,
      so we’ll just say that we hope you find a way to turn lemons into sweet
      golden Lemonade.


      Oh, and Athena D’Monaco… on the main stage, you delivered a real live

      They couldn’t quite rocket till water falls. Are they suffering from a
      Love Drought, or just a W drought? Even on their worst day, are these
      DJ-led Whorals not thirsty enough to turn their season around? Will Mark
      return from his forest hideaway to the lights and the beams? We have as

      They were finally able to score more than one touchdown in a game, with TJ
      demonstrating his ballet skills spinning his way down the field and into
      the endzone. Do it baby spin it, now spin it baby do it! This team may not
      be delivering on the field, but they are a consistent sight at Sunday
