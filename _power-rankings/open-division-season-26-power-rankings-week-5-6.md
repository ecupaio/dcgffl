      Here’s a haiku for Royal Blue inspired by Taylor Swift’s “Dead Poets
      Society” album:


      You are number one.


      Did you show up hungover?


      Double-header next.

      *Week 5 (1st)*: I’d say I’m surprised, but it seems like we’re getting a
      repeat of Season 25 with JC leading his team to an undefeated season. To
      make matters worse, Royal was missing about a third of their roster and
      they still won…

      this is the team to watch over the next three weeks.

      *Week 5 (5th):* The girlies will be mad you’re this high in the rankings.
      However, you dodged a bullet with this forfeit and you know it! I hope you
      enjoyed your Sunday Funday.

      Grey 4 Pay showed up and showed out on Sunday winning both games in their
      double-header weekend. They were one-point games but a win is a win. How
      long can they keep this energy going? \#AaronSforSportsperson

      *Week 5 (7th):* It was one of the closest games of the day and these
      players held it together to come out on top. Great plays by the Matt duo
      leading their team to victory. With two double headers coming up, can this
      team take it all the way?

      Listen, you didn’t have to do my team (Seafoam) like that. When I said
      more points on the scoreboard I meant on another team. At least buy us a
      drink before you ask us to “bend over to the front and touch your toes.”

      *Week 5 (3rd):* I was expecting more from this team. Maybe more exciting
      plays, maybe more points on the scoreboard. I can’t quite put my finger on
      it. But sitting at number 3 this week, this team has something going
      right.

      *Week 5 (18th):* Wait, what? What are we doing? How did we get here? Trust
      me, I am shocked too. But listen, when you take yourself out of the game,
      this is where you end up. Hopefully, it is only temporary.

      Last week, I ranked you second and I’m not mad about it. Sadly, I didn’t
      make it to the fields for those sideline snacks, but these Barbies ate in
      their first game against Cardinal. Unfortunately, that wasn’t the story
      for the second game. Whomp whomp!

      *Week 5 (2nd):* I like the energy on this team. Finding themselves almost
      at the top, this week’s doubleheader against very tough teams might be a
      tough ride for these Barbies…

      All good things take time and each week this team is getting better and
      better. With a decent schedule remaining, I’ll be interested in their
      progress.

      *Week 5 (6th):* The talent on this team is pretty remarkable. I can tell
      Captain Michael B. wants another shot at the championship game this
      season.

      Several late arrivals during their first game gave Pink a slow start. They

      Seafoam.

      *Week 5 (9th):* It was a close game for Pink Pony Club and Olive. Luckily,
      Pink surpassed their opponent despite some confusion on a touchdown. BTW,
      do we still have that PEP rule? Just wondering…

      I am trying to keep my job (not really a job) as a power rankings writer
      so I won’t mention the drama, reprimand, discussion, and undoing that
      occurred during the game. A lot of back and forth, like this game. Sadly,
      these hot ones were a little too…cold.

      width="360" height="198"}


      *Week 5 (4th):* Coming off the field, CRR was a bit miffed that the
      sideline was silent even though you were in no danger of losing against
      Atomic. The big reveal was Zo’s jersey being ripped off by the opposing
      team. If I got a quarter every time a jersey ripped on the field…I’d be
      able to buy this team some sideline cheers.

      It was a back-and-forth game until Olive allowed Grey to pick up some
      steam. I still see a lot of potential in this team and I’m not ready to
      count them out yet.

      *Week 5 (10th):* An even split on Sunday and overall record for these
      Virgins. I saw some great plays from this team on the field and can see
      them being “extra extra” dangerous during the playoffs.

      Rant: Somebody is really playin’ in our face right now. Two double-header
      weekends back to back and we had to play both games on the Maryland
      field?!? Keep your heads up, Foamies, we’re coming back bigger and better
      for the playoffs, final four, and championship. P.S. - I’ll be a better
      forever family member, smooches.

      *Week 5 (8th):* First off, I would like to comment card on the FIVE 9:00am
      games our team had on the schedule this season. Luckily, we play the last
      one this week – you can sleep in a little Jean. We finally found our
      stride last Sunday winning both games. A second double-header Sunday will
      hopefully bring another double win for these Foamies.

      Things were looking pretty good for Light Blue at halftime until Neon
      Orange found some mid-game energy and dominated. Looks like you’ll need to
      go BIGGER for a win this week.

      width="498" height="375"}


      *Week 5 (11th):* The average age of this team is \[redacted\] but they
      still got it. Though they didn’t quite show it this week against White;
      they’ll need to go big for a win this week.

      OK CORAL, I see you! Y’all said, “We’ve learned from our mistakes last
      week and we’re in it to win it!” Several players had a great game and the
      entire team banded together to pull out a win in double overtime against
      Atomic.

      width="400" height="224"}


      *Week 5 (15th):* Talk about a battle! I heard this team was so close to
      tying the game and going into overtime had a certain player not made a
      last-second mistake. We all know the regular season is “just for fun” and
      I can see this team doing some damage during playoffs.

      *Week 5 (12th):* Sunday wasn’t too great for Grape Sexpectations and
      things got a little heated on the sideline from the offense. They played
      their second doubleheader weekend of the season against the number one
      team in the league (Royal) and a team that’s on its way to a top spot
      (Seafoam). *Shout out to My Little Foamies*


      Don’t let last week get you down, you’re playing Vegas Gold next…you’ll be
      fine.

      Maybe all that partyin’ at Sunday Funday got the best of Atomic as they
      fought through a double-overtime loss to Coral this week. I heard the
      sidelines were getting a bit heated although not as feisty as other games
      (oh, we will go there later). I did get to Shake ‘N Bake (Shakers) this
      week and can verify this team has a good time on and off the field.

      *Week 5 (13th):* This team has a lot of spirit. I love the sideline chants
      and overall energy. I hear the second half of the game did not fare well
      for The Atoms, but they sure know how to have a good time at Sunday
      Funday.

      It’s been a while since this team has seen a W on the scoreboard. Last
      week, I advised Purple not to sweat their L because they play Gold next
      and we saw what happened… So this is me saying “bring your A game” and by
      “A” I mean Andy, Amanda, and A. Gordo (love you, mean it!)

      knew its fate long before the game started but, they played with a lot of
      heart and enthusiasm.

      *Week 5 (17th):* I’m impressed. No, for real. I’ve never seen a team with
      a whiteboard and Expo markers charting out X’s and O’s at halftime. The
      organization and professionalism is superior, but this team just can’t
      figure out the right strategy. Don’t worry, queens, your butterflies will
      take flight one day.
