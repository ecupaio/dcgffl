  Season 26 is starting to come to a close. As we begin wrapping up the regular
  season next week, I think it is time to take stock and evaluate each team on
  one very important characteristic. Which Pokemon would each team be?! That’s
  right, betches! Buckle up because it is Power Rankings: Pokemon Edition.  By

      Charizard.


      Since Generation 1 (the original 151 pokemon for non pokemon fans),
      Charizard has been a mainstay in the Pokemon games. Since Week 1, Royal
      Tightness has continued to stay relevant in the league rankings. This week
      is no different. Is Charizard a little boring to Pokemon fans now? Yeah.
      But after another two wins this week, they continue to show why they are
      at the top.

      *Week 5 (1st)*: I’d say I’m surprised, but it seems like we’re getting a
      repeat of Season 25 with JC leading his team to an undefeated season. To
      make matters worse, Royal was missing about a third of their roster and
      they still won…

      Eevee. <br>This week You Got Moss’d proved to be a versatile team with
      everyone getting a little bit of the action. Levert, Brendan, Twon, and
      even AJ getting points on the board. This team has multiple offensive
      strategies going into the final week, that is if they decide they want to
      play their game.

      *Week 5 (5th):* The girlies will be mad you’re this high in the rankings.
      However, you dodged a bullet with this forfeit and you know it! I hope you
      enjoyed your Sunday Funday.

      Machoke.


      Damn Good Lime put up a good fight this week in their double header. Like
      Machoke, Ben has an arm with multiple strong receivers to throw to this
      week- like Tom, Dawson, and Nick. On defense, it was Sack City with Tevin
      and Isaiah getting some flag pulls throughout the day. This team can put
      up a fight, but they are no Machamp after losing their second game by just
      four points.

      *Week 5 (3rd):* I was expecting more from this team. Maybe more exciting
      plays, maybe more points on the scoreboard. I can’t quite put my finger on
      it. But sitting at number 3 this week, this team has something going
      right.

      Chansey.


      It is fitting to give Neon My Face Chansey, as Keyur went full doctor mode
      to help Sean with a dislocated finger. Despite the injury, the team
      bounced back and beat Seafoam by 9. Bryan could learn to share the egg
      with his teammates a little more after racking up 26 points himself.

      *Week 5 (18th):* Wait, what? What are we doing? How did we get here? Trust
      me, I am shocked too. But listen, when you take yourself out of the game,
      this is where you end up. Hopefully, it is only temporary.

      Snorlax.


      Was Matt H’s unsportsman-like conduct this week a sign of a louder, more
      aggressive Gray 4 Pay? Probably not. The quietest team in the league gets
      the one of the chillest Pokemon. Matt C has a hyper beam of an arm with
      strong receivers like Lindsey and Jared to throw to. However, it is
      unfortunate that after being up by a touchdown at half time, Gray slept on
      the win and lost by ten.

      width="499" height="374"}


      *Week 5 (7th):* It was one of the closest games of the day and these
      players held it together to come out on top. Great plays by the Matt duo
      leading their team to victory. With two double headers coming up, can this
      team take it all the way?

      Rapidash.


      The Blacked Out Barbies have incredible speed stats and are quick to move
      the ball. But his week they were more or less a one trick pony. Besides a
      touchdown from Mike and 2 point conversion from Thomas, 27 of the 35
      points came from Paul.

      *Week 5 (2nd):* I like the energy on this team. Finding themselves almost
      at the top, this week’s doubleheader against very tough teams might be a
      tough ride for these Barbies…

      Scyther.


      Field of Creams were able to cut through their opponent this week with an
      incredible show on offense. Michael, Oriya, and Randall all clenching pick
      sixes. I am sure they were bugging Coral during what became a very one
      sided game at the end.

      *Week 5 (6th):* The talent on this team is pretty remarkable. I can tell
      Captain Michael B. wants another shot at the championship game this
      season.

      Garchomp.


      Garchomp can be a fierce competitor or their opponent can have an ice beam
      and take them out. Unfortunately, Lime had an ice beam this week and
      stopped the Pink Pony Club’s defenses.

      *Week 5 (9th):* It was a close game for Pink Pony Club and Olive. Luckily,
      Pink surpassed their opponent despite some confusion on a touchdown. BTW,
      do we still have that PEP rule? Just wondering…

      Dratini.


      There were high expectations for this team. But with Lamar out for surgery
      (get better soon, Lamar!) and Cam unable to attend this week, the team was
      not able to evolve into a legendary force.

      width="360" height="198"}


      *Week 5 (4th):* Coming off the field, CRR was a bit miffed that the
      sideline was silent even though you were in no danger of losing against
      Atomic. The big reveal was Zo’s jersey being ripped off by the opposing
      team. If I got a quarter every time a jersey ripped on the field…I’d be
      able to buy this team some sideline cheers.

      Abomasnow.


      Like My Little Foamies, Abomasnow has some great stats, but the Ice/Grass
      type has quite a few weaknesses. With one of their stronger players MIA
      and Jean Henry getting sat out after two person fouls, they were frozen
      and unable to recover against Neon Orange.

      *Week 5 (8th):* First off, I would like to comment card on the FIVE 9:00am
      games our team had on the schedule this season. Luckily, we play the last
      one this week – you can sleep in a little Jean. We finally found our
      stride last Sunday winning both games. A second double-header Sunday will
      hopefully bring another double win for these Foamies.

      Lapras.


      Lapras is a fun, popular pokemon, so when they play you expect them to be
      more effective than they are on the field. Despite their best efforts with
      three interceptions by Juan, Brandon, and Art, they were unable to freeze
      out Black.

      width="500" height="500"}


      *Week 5 (10th):* An even split on Sunday and overall record for these
      Virgins. I saw some great plays from this team on the field and can see
      them being “extra extra” dangerous during the playoffs.

      Slowking.


      It looks like the Belagi-Hos have finally shown up and it only took until
      week 6 and 7. This week they won both double header games in fierce
      competition with Yellow and Atomic Blue. Shout out to Birthday Boy
      Bradley, who came to play and got two sacks and a touchdown.

      week after that.

      Tauros. <br>The Blue Bombers came into this week charging through Cardinal
      with Luis, Brandon B, Bryan and Sam all running down touchdowns. It may be
      bullish to say, but they may be getting the momentum for a strong run at
      the playoffs.

      they’ll need to go big for a win this week.

      Dugtrio. <br>Whoral sort of dug their own grave this week after a few too
      many pick sixes that allowed white to overtake them. But it is great to
      see many of them at Sunday Funday. Even after a loss they still pop out of
      the ground and go out afterwards.

      *Week 5 (15th):* Talk about a battle! I heard this team was so close to
      tying the game and going into overtime had a certain player not made a
      last-second mistake. We all know the regular season is “just for fun” and
      I can see this team doing some damage during playoffs.

      Arcanine.


      Like a Flamethrower, tempers ran high this week between Atoms Family and
      Vegas Gold, resulting in the refs calling on both teams to stop
      complaining after every call. However, their double header wasn’t all
      drama as the Atoms Family were quick enough to pull out at least one.

      for The Atoms, but they sure know how to have a good time at Sunday
      Funday.

      Grape Sexpectations is a fun team with a lot of energy. Like Pikachu, they
      are not always competitive, but they are a mainstay of the league.
      Hopefully the spark catches in the last week.

      *Week 5 (12th):* Sunday wasn’t too great for Grape Sexpectations and
      things got a little heated on the sideline from the offense. They played
      their second doubleheader weekend of the season against the number one
      team in the league (Royal) and a team that’s on its way to a top spot
      (Seafoam). *Shout out to My Little Foamies*
