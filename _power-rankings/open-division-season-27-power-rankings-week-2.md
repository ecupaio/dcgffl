  Chris Riotta-Rogers. Feel that buzz in the air? D.C.’s been humming with fresh
  energy and excitement lately. No, it’s not Kamala Harris’s latest speech—it’s
  the delusional hope that the gays will finally dethrone JC in the DCGFFL this
  season.  Your favorite shady baddie is back with the latest tea from America’s
  second—or maybe third—favorite pastime, Carter Barron style. So grab a cup,
  kick back, and let’s spill. And since I’m a journalist, this special edition
  of the Power Rankings will be written entirely in headlines, subheads, and
  GIFs - no ChatGPT allowed.

      **ALL TIDE UP Flattens Dune as Coral Coasts to Victory**


      *Sand's rush fails to shift sand's fate as coral washes over dune in
      surfside smackdown.*


      This team is, predictably and statistically, ranked number one. I really
      have nothing left to say besides may the odds be in literally everyone
      else’s favor.

      **ARCH YOUR BLACK Squeezes Tang Bang Dry in Latest Juicy Blowout**


      *Penny Makes Family Proud as Honeycutt Kills It with Kindness*


      This is the unity ticket of power teams: Leadership, organizational drive
      and just enough flair to easily earn them a top four position.

      **FOAM FATALES Win Tsunami of Points as Naughty Nauti Boys Sink Fast**


      *Macpherson Suffers Fatal Defeat Week After Mother's Visit; Riotta-Rogers
      Calls Out Binder's 'Flat Ass,' Somehow Still Earns Sportsperson Award*


      Personally speaking, this is one of my favorite teams yet: I mean, we've
      got athletes, hotties and even a few fellow fashionistas. I have no doubt
      you'll be seeing us in the championships.

      **SPILL THE COYO-TEA Serves Up Steaming Defeat to Dirty, Filthy Whore
      D'oeuvres**


      *Coyote Team Gives Body Tea and Touchdowns in Latest Victory*


      Between Dwaylan's body tea (waist where?!) and BB's men's bra version of
      the DCGFFL uniform, it was admittedly difficult to pay attention to
      anything sports-wise for this team. But I'm very much excited to continue
      watching them sail their way to victory over these dirty, filthy, no good
      whore...do'oeuvres.

      **LAVENDER GAYZE Clouds Uncut Gems in Fog of Victory**


      *Lavender Floats to Victory in High Scoring Game Against Unpolished Gems*


      A top-tier team with some raw, hidden talent scattered throughout. Let's
      see if this crew of youngins can climb the corporate ladder!

      **BUMP A LITTLE LIME Gets Zesty After Squeezing Victory Out of Kelly
      Green**


      *Lime Shines Bright as Kelly Suffers Bitter Taste of Defeat*


      This team feels deeply unpredictable to me. It's like chasing rail tequila
      with a shot of lime - we'll hope for the best, but prepare for the worst.

      **50 SHADES OF SLAY Edges Out PikaCrew in Deeply Close Call**


      *Dark Gray Slays Path to Victory After Defeating Unprepped Pokemon*


      Will this team be able to hold its own when it comes up against a
      championship-level challenger, or crawl back into the dark and shady hole
      it came from?

      **TROP DEAD GORGEOUS Death Drops Milk and Pookies in Tropical Beatdown**


      *Gorgeous Athletes Defeat Stale Cookie Cutter Team as White Left Spoiled
      Rotten*


      This team has charm, athleticism and some very solid facial hair. But can
      drop dead gorgeous looks win a trophy? We shall see.

      **BLUE LIGHT DISTRICT Shines, RED WINE SUPERNOVAS Whine**


      *Cardinals Ferment in Defeat After Getting Corked in Close Finish*


      I'm excited for this team, which features one of my favorite straight
      quarterbacks and a few solid athletes. Maybe they're ranked halfway
      because I'm hoping to push them to further victory. Or maybe it's because
      I've played with Garrett and I'm aware of his shortcomings.


      (That was a long wind up for a throwaway short king joke.

      **NAUGHTY NAUTI BOYS No More: Foam Soaks Up Nautis in Seafoam Slam**


      *Riotta-Rogers Calls Mrs. MacPherson Following Game to Discuss Son's
      Embarrassing Defeat; What's Next for the Family Football Dynasty?*


      This team's quarterback is the All-American dream, but his team hasn't yet
      found it's all-star footing. Hoping a little tough love gives them the
      boost in confidence needed to secure a spot in the championships. The
      season is still young, unlike many on this team of aging athletes!

      **DUNE TOO MUCH Swept Over as Coral Stays Afloat and Sand Crumbles Under
      Pressure**


      *Sand Slips Through the Cracks as All Tide Up Reigns Supreme*


      How you Dune? This team has one of the best rushers in the league, a mix
      of height, strength and stamina, and a quarterback who truly slays if he
      can just get the ball out of his damn hands in under 30 minutes.

      **UNCUT GEMS Lost in the Fog as Lavender Haze Rolls Through to Victory**


      *Gems Left Dazed and Dusty in Dazzling Defeat as Lavender Haze Glistens*


      This is a fun team, with some very attractive men, so I should be careful
      how I choose my words. Perhaps a few diamonds in the rough will emerge
      this season, but unfortunately I'm not predicting a championship spot for
      y'all. Best of luck tho cuties.

      **MILK & POOKIES Spoiling Fast and Looking Crummy After Multiple Ls**


      *Santa Don't Want These Pookies: Can Team White Rebuild After Soggy
      Showing?*


      I was rooting for you, we were all rooting for you! Y'all better turn
      things around and give us a white Christmas by the end of the season! Or
      at the very least, a white Russian. (I'm running out of puns here, guys.)

      **RED WINE SUPERNOVA Gets Lit Up and Pours One Out After Close but
      Crushing Defeat**


      *Team Red Falls Flat and Blue Light District Turns the Tables , Leaving
      Red Wine Swirling*


      These supernovas are about to burn out unless they can lick their wounds
      and come back from the bottom of the bottle. Pour another cup of red and
      get out there, boys!

      Behind**


      *Tang Bang Flattened in Fruity Fashion, Proving Commercially Attractive
      Looks Only Get You So Far*


      Maybe this team should leave the cleats on at their next tang bang in
      order to squeeze in a practice before week three?

      **KELLY GREEN Left Reeling as Bump a Little Lime Serves Up a Sour Finish**


      *Bump a Little Lime Zips Past Kelly Green in Tangy Tussle*


      This was a rough one for you guys, no easy way to put it. Maybe the low
      ranking will make you green with envy for a few more Ws. I'm not banking
      on it, though.

      Disgusting Defeat**


      *No Good, Filthy Whore D'oeuvres Face Another Humiliating Defeat, Bringing
      Shame to Their Families*


      I would never want to shame a sex worker, but these whore d'oeuvres should
      probably stick to their day jobs.

      **PIKACREW, I Definitely Don't Choose You After Crushing Loss**


      *Pika, Pika! PikaCrew Suffers Yet Another Defeat*


      Ash is probably wondering whether he can return some of his loose
      pokeballs after the first few weeks of this season with the PikaCrew. Fear
      not, you untrained pikachus: There are plenty of Charizards on this league
      who can show you how to throw some real fire on the field. See you at the
      pokegym.
