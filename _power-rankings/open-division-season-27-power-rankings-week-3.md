  superstar, Jazzmin St. James D’Monaco, AKA Darryl giving you these late (as
  usual) power rankings for Week 3. Here’s the thing - it’s been rainy AF all
  week and I’ve been in my feels, so these comments are coming at you with a
  Jazzmin/Darryl’s TBH (to be honest) attached to them. So buckle up because
  none of this will make sense….

      After a pretty impressive doubleheader weekend, the AJ/Twon duo is at the
      top of this week's pyramid.


      TBH: Contrary to popular opinion, the AJ/Twon duo is actually really good.

      Yup, you guessed it, another win for JC and his teammates. I believe this
      was JC’s 30th DCGFFL win in a row (someone fact-check me). If so, that’s
      pretty impressive.


      TBH: I’m impressed.

      This team is finding their stride and coming together nicely on the field.

      TBH: I could see this team making it to the Final 4

      In the words of Kris Jenner, “You’re doing amazing, sweetie”


      TBH: I only know a few names on this roster, but they are killin’ it - so
      keep it up!

      A one-point loss never seems fair and tough to shake off, but I know this
      roster will make some big upset in the coming weeks. After getting flipped
      in what can only be described as WWE at Carton Barron, our fearless
      commissioner states, “It didn’t hurt my body, but it hurt my pride”


      TBH: I saw that flip with my own eyes; it looked pretty bad.

      Dark Gray tried to hold it together but just couldn’t pull out the W
      against the Foam Fatales.


      TBH: I had heard there was some misinformation and fake news spreading on
      the field to confuse the refs.

      People will underestimate this team, but I see a lot of potential in the
      coming weeks.


      TBH: I hope everyone on the team gets the 3-in shorts that match the
      jersey by the end of the season. You’re already 2/13.

      With a bit of a skeleton crew, the Trops held their own against the Foam
      Fatales. Unfortunately, it wasn’t enough for the W. They kept it cute,
      but…


      TBH: Nothing to do with flag football, Alyssa Edwards is my favorite!!

      Coming away with a two-week win streak is always a great feeling. Hope you
      can keep it…up.


      TBH: I had to look up the blue light district, and I wonder if this team
      knows it’s a thing..

      It was the 60-yard TD by Luke B. that made me clutch my pearl necklace.
      Was it his showcase of pure athleticism or the fact that he almost threw
      up afterward? The world may never know.


      TBH: I left the fields after that touchdown.

      They say ‘you can’t turn a whore into a housewife’, but you can turn a
      whore into a WINNER for Olive!


      TBH: There’s always a “nicest team” of the season and I believe Olive is
      that team. Great chemistry and camaraderie on and off the field. &lt;3

      It looks to be a naught-so-great beginning of the season for the Navy
      team. These seamen still need to raise their sails to put their boat on
      course—or else…


      TBH: Evan B. did a really great job as QB this week. He threw 5 touchdown
      passes, sadly 2 of them were for the other team.

      I was going to say “Dune too much? Maybe this team is dune too little”
      but...


      TBH: This team is not to be played with - don’t let their record fool you.

      This team had great control at the beginning of the game, but somehow
      could not hold it together during the second half. A few snippy words with
      the refs might have caused things to go awry.


      TBH: On paper this team seems unstoppable, but...

      I’m sure the team missed having QB Hotchkiss on the field, however, Ben M.
      stepped in putting up a great fight against the Milk & Pookies.


      TBH: This is another feel good/nice team, too.

      We’ve seen this Capt/QB duo before in a previous season, can they pull off
      a better record the second time around? Time will tell.


      <br>TBH: I’m surprised at how mobile Brandon W. is as QB. The knees might
      lie, but those hips do not…

      I feel like we’re on Punk’d or Candid Camera with this team. LIke, stop
      playing..frfr or start playing, idk.


      TBH: The math isn’t mathing with this roster and their ranking. I’m
      shooketh!

      Listen, it’s only Week 3 and there’s a lot of football left. Like our
      motto states, “get off the bench and get into the game”


      TBH: So, get off the bench and get into the game.
