      Well!!!! With a performance that this team did 2 Sundays ago, it‚Äôs not a
      surprise who is taking the number 1 spot this week!!! Pulling a whopping
      11 sacks and holding cardinal to 1 TD the entire game, Seafoam‚Äôs defense
      is showing that they are holding the crown and who else represents the
      Queen than Beyonce‚Äôs iconic halftime show in 2013 during Super Bowl XLVII

      Nothing is better in this world than when a dynamic duo emerges on the
      scene. Kinda like how we felt when they said Shakira and J. Lo were
      performing together for Super Bowl LVI.


      For the longest it looked as though AJ and Twon would hold that title. But
      after their loss to this Coral team, it appears that a new supreme duo is
      on the rise with JC and Andrew G. who are STILL riding their almost
      30-game winning streak and back to back championships!! Let‚Äôs see if the
      new dynamic duo can make it a hat trick and go 3-for-3?

      Looking at this team, Kevin Penny has a team of weapons at his disposal,
      with more than half of his team having points scored during the first 5
      games (Paul, Penny, Justin, Nolan, Gabriel, Daniel, Nolan, & Shaq).


      You know Super Bowl halftime shows are usually good, but they reach Icon
      status when you have a multitude of artists on display. Like back in 2001
      during Superbowl XXXV when you had Aerosmith, Britney Spears, ‚ÄòNSync,
      Nelly & Mary J. Blige all take the stage at one time! Talk about a
      powerhouse performance both the show and from the looks of it, this
      team!!!

      Now I may have said that AJ and Twon may be losing their ‚ÄúDynamic Duo‚Äù
      title, but Twon is still showing up and showing out. Currently reigning
      with the highest ToT Points scored this season, with 2nd place 18 points
      behind him!


      This Captain is showing that he can put the team on his back and lead to
      the top. You know who else possessed that kind of power? Prince did back
      in 2007 during Super Bowl XLI. I mean if you haven‚Äôt watched Prince
      perform Purple Rain in the pouring rain, such a sight!!!

      Every now and then, you get to watch a performance from a legend, and
      you‚Äôre reminded again just how great they are. This season we are getting
      to witness Trainwreck back to form as he continues to pull out clutch
      plays to secure his team the win! In 2002, in the wake of 9/11, Super Bowl
      XXXVI featured the legendary band U2 and reminded America how great their
      music is. Look like Jim is following suit and we love to watch it.

      One thing I always know when it comes to both the league as well as Super
      Bowl halftime shows; sometimes the ones you don‚Äôt think will do well
      actually be really good!!! This Purple team is definitely showing that
      with Captain Morgan in his first year as a captain and QB Aaron in his
      second year as this team is averaging 30 points per game.


      I remember back in 2014 when I heard that Katy Perry was going to headline
      Super Bowl XLIX and I was like‚Ä¶üòÆ‚Äçüí® but little did I know that she was
      going to bring out the icon Missy Elliott and turned that performance into
      a showstopper!!!

      Well, we‚Äôve talked about solo acts, duos, and even groups. Might as well
      discuss the power of the trio!! Tropic is probably the best team that
      displays the power of a trio with Matt Cline having a powerful trio to
      throw to in Juan, Edward, and Alex.


      What makes this group is that all three have the power to stand alone, but
      together they are magical. Just like we saw in 2016 during Super Bowl 50
      when Coldplay decided that they wasn‚Äôt enough and added Bruno Mars
      headlined in 2014 and Beyonce who headlined the year before him.

      Sitting at .500 isn‚Äôt too bad for veteran Captain/QB pairing of Evan and
      Cam as they bounced back with a win over Tropic. Looking at the team
      stats, Cam is passing the ball around well, but could use a little more
      help in preventing him from getting sacked.


      But overall, a solid performance from a team that will probably have a
      good season. Solid‚Ä¶ just like Usher‚Äôs halftime performance from this
      year!!!

      As rapper Murphy Lee said in his 2003 hit ‚Äú...what goes up, must come
      down‚Äù and it looks like Coyote is on a downslope with back to back losses
      to Coral and Deep Orange. Not too mention they are about to face a very
      strong Lime team next week. But through the ups and downs, this team
      always manages to stay classy, very much like the Grand Diva herself‚Ä¶Diana
      Ross!!! And during Super Bowl XXX Diana looked FAB-U-LOUS!!!!

      I had the pleasure of watching this team the other week and I must
      celebrate Cam and Garrett for taking the opportunity to allow their
      rookies to get to learn the game and get some reps in! Although they ended
      the day with a loss to Sapphire, they have shown the ability to pull out
      wins and so I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing what they‚Äôll do in the second
      half of the season!!!


      I really enjoy hanging out with them and this feels like a team that is a
      lot of fun. Which is the same feeling I had in 2003 when I saw Shania
      Twain headline Super Bowl XXXVII with Sting and No Doubt (*fyi - for you
      Gen Zers, that was the band Gwen Stefani was with before going solo*).

      So back in 2022, Super Bowl LVI had Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Mary J.
      Blige, 50 Cent, and Kendrick Lamar headline the show and change the view
      of hip-hop/rap in the Super Bowl (*FYI: next year‚Äôs Super Bowl will be
      headlined by Kendrick Lamar*).


      Just like that performance changed the culture, Sapphire‚Äôs Doubleheader
      wins last week changed my perception of them. After a very slow start this
      season, and a major pickup in Andre, Sapphire has right the ship, securing
      two strong wins against Light Blue and Kelly Green!!! Now if they continue
      to play this way, I think that this team may be in contention for a
      championship this season!!!

      Pat wanted to make sure that I highlighted his amazing TD pass to Jordan
      Anderson during their game against White. But other than getting out of
      what I am dubbing the ‚Äú0-and-Club‚Äù so far this season hasn‚Äôt been the best
      showing for Yellow, especially as they head into Sunday to face the
      top-dawg Seafoam team.


      It‚Äôs not that this team is a bad team, I think this collection of players
      has shown stronger performances in previous seasons‚Ä¶Justin Timberlake
      knows something about that, seeing that his halftime show during Super
      Bowl LII in 2018 left many fans wanting more. But maybe it was just
      because he couldn‚Äôt escape that previous iconic ‚Äúincident‚Äù.

      It‚Äôs always unfortunate when wrong one play changes the game. During their
      game with Dark Grey, I kept saying ‚Äúthe team that makes the first mistake
      in the 2nd half is going to lose.‚Äù And thats exactly what happened thanks
      to a 2nd half interception and some mis-management with the clock.


      You know, there‚Äôs an artist who knows far too well how one moment in the
      Super Bowl can impact the outcome of so much‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt have to say their
      name, but I‚Äôll use a Sophia from Golden Girls reference to set the scene.


      ‚ÄúPicture it‚Ä¶Super XXXVIII in 2004. \#NippleGate‚Ä¶.‚Äônuff said

      That‚Äôs the issue right here‚Ä¶they‚Äôre actually NOT ‚ÄúDune Too Much!‚Äù The team
      is 12th in Total points this season and tied in 10th for extra points
      scored. Oriya is doing a great job in keeping the ball out of the other
      team‚Äôs hand but for some reason it is not translating into wins for the
      team.


      With upcoming games against Black and Seafoam, I hope that this team can
      withstand the tides, otherwise they may end up falling away like sand in
      an hourglass into the back of people‚Äôs mind. Speaking of the back of
      people‚Äôs mind, I feel like I forgot that The Weeknd headlined Super Bowl
      LV‚Ä¶I wonder how many other people forgot as well.

      Looking at the stats of this team, they shouldn‚Äôt be this far down the
      list. Outside of the first game against Navy, they always manage to lose
      under one touchdown. Plus, Andrew manages to get the ball around to
      various team members such as Ben T, Brandon, and captain TJ.


      But maybe that‚Äôs the problem, so far nothing about their play has stood
      out. Don‚Äôt get me wrong it's good playing, just not *memorable* playing
      (*Although TJ yapping at Jordan does stick out! ü§£*). And like this team
      there are several halftime shows that have faded like the sands of time.
      Such as Bruno Mars and the Red Hot Chili Peppers‚Äô 2014 performance during
      Super Bowl XLVIII.


      Well guys, you got 5 more games to wake it on up!!!

      First of all lets celebrate Deep Orange escaping the ‚Äú0-and-‚Äù Club with
      their win over Coyote. Looks like picking up Ocho in supplemental, who I‚Äôm
      glad to see is back on the field full time, is working in their favor.
      Can‚Äôt wait to see if this continues as they get ready to face another team
      who experienced a bounce back themselves, in Sapphire on Sunday.


      You know I was doing some reflecting on Super Bowl halftime history, and I
      noticed that Gloria Estafan performed in 1992, in what many rank as one of
      the worst Super Bowl halftime shows in history. However, with the help of
      R&B legend Stevie Wonder, she was able to redeem herself during Super Bowl
      XXXIII in 1999.


      I hope this will be the same fate for Deep Orange‚Ä¶ü§∑

      So I haven‚Äôt gotten a chance to see this team in action yet, but from what
      I hear, last Sunday was a rough one for them as Seafoam had a field day
      with them‚Ä¶while on the field! But this is their Doubleheader week as they
      take on both Navy and Olive. So there is hope for this team to pull out at
      least one win.


      What I will say is this team plays and feels like I‚Äôm seeing a band of
      brothers come together to win!!! And speaking of Brothers, did yall know
      that the Blues Brothers headlined Super Bowl XXXI in 1997 with James Brown
      and ZZ Top??!


      No??!!! Good then I don‚Äôt feel bad that I didn‚Äôt either. üòÇ

      üòÆ‚Äçüí®‚Ä¶I really hated to write this one, because when you look at this
      lineup for this team, its a team full of veteran players like Dan, Paul,
      Nick, and Gideon. However, they have had to play against top teams such as
      Lime, Coral, and Black and went head to head with Sapphire who has just
      picked up Andre. Sunday they play an evenly matched team in White, so
      maybe this will be the chance to finally get a win under their belt.


      Otherwise, it may be one of those teams that looks like it‚Äôll be a good
      one, but ends up being a hot mess‚Ä¶& I don‚Äôt want this team to have the
      same fate as the Black Eyed Peas, whos 2011 halftime show during Super
      Bowl XLV ranks as the worst Super Bowl halftime show of all according to
      Rolling Stones Magazine
