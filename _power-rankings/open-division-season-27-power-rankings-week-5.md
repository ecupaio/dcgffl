  Andrew Grafton and Pete D. This week was marked by the sudden departure of
  many league members, spirited away by the mysterious and ever-stronger force
  of the DCGFFL-DCGBL pipeline.  For those of us left behind in the rapture,
  spooky, eerie, and sometimes unnatural sights abounded. Some teams were left
  bewitched, bothered and bewildered without their usual lineups. Others rose up
  from the grave to take revenge on the remaining living. Grab your bedknobs and
  broomsticks — or whatever else y’all are into these days — and let’s dive in.

      Seafoam remained in top seaform this week. Glad to see it’s not just a
      one-player show as captain and runaway stat leader Luie was absent while
      several others haunted the score sheet (Scott Graham still has some
      moves)! This team has the depth and QB to win it all, but let a resurgent
      Yellow almost knock them off. Can they avoid the big upset?

      No JC, no problem. Hoyler put on his best Drew Brees impression – minus a
      couple fun little interceptions – and organized Coral to another victory.
      With a frighteningly good pass rush and several solid receivers, this team
      has found new ways to win every week. Coral’s biggest scare might be a
      Sunday morning hangover lurking in the shadows after this team, including
      the undersigned, closes down the bars on Saturdays.

      Same song, different verse. Lime seemed completely un-bothered and
      bewitched by Coyote in this shootout of a game, continuing a trend of
      AJ-Twon dominance this week. Whatever you’re putting in those midnight
      margaritas ladies, it’s working.

      The Jim Connolly Revival continues for Dark (Horse) Grey, who are riding
      the 2nd most passing TDs to a hot start to the season. This team has
      roared into form at just the right time, aided by the fact that not as
      many of their players were going swish swish this weekend.

      This team wasn’t so much arching into it this week as holding on for dear
      life without their captain and some other key players. They were down in
      the first half, then with the help of a Nolan INT tied it back up in the
      second, only to ultimately succumb to the pounding of a confident and
      assertive Sand. The undersigned walked off this game with a gnarly, very
      bloody nose injury (thank you cute nurses Dawson and Thomas!). Taking
      recommendations for appropriate face covers.

      I honestly can’t fault Purple for dropping another game when half their
      receivers were going to be missing and Pennywise came up from the sewers
      to claim Dawson a few days before the game. But somehow, playing their 4th
      string QB and with an offense that was mostly “save me Bryan Burke,” they
      still cooked the undersigned and came within a point of knocking off
      Coral. Despite their record, this is still a resilient, talented team and
      they will be a force in November.

      Captain Juan remains the baddest witch on this team, but he’s been joined
      by his sisters Matt Cline and Edward J. on the score sheet. Can they keep
      their spell on the rest of the league, or will this team turn to stone in
      the playoffs?

    record: 3-2

      Navy was fully in command this week, and booty was done plundered. Captain
      Cam continued to do a great job spreading the ball around deck to his
      fellow seamen (sp?), as well as intercepting and defusing rival captain
      Hotchkiss’s cannons. Not many cracks in the hull showing today.

      The old Sand can’t come to the phone right now. Why? I think you know.
      Gotta hand it to this team — also missing important players, they knocked
      off a much higher-ranked Black. Oriya was characteristically everywhere on
      both sides of the ball. Great pass protection from Gordo helped, who
      clearly had our names in red underlined (once he expelled his curse of the
      drops, bless his heart). As has been long foreseen, this team is
      officially risen back from the grave.

      Coyote, we know you’re not Ugly, you had a tough matchup, and snagging two
      INT’s shows you kept your heads (partly) on during the game. But after
      giving 34 points to Lime, might we suggest a little beauty elixir?

      White looked like it had seen a ghost when they were tied at halftime this
      week – was it Zuul or was it just the hungry, winless Kelly Green? Either
      way, vacuum cleaners were put to good use as they sucked up the points in
      the second half and lived to ghostbust another day.

      The dads have still got it! They kept the tang banging, following last
      week’s W with another hefty win over Sapphire, including Chad going
      *extra* deep to nab 3 sacks. They may not be exactly a team of Teenage
      Witches, but aunties Zelda and Hilda were the real stars all along.

      The saucy sirens of the Blue Light District couldn’t keep the other team’s
      hands off them this week, with Dark Grey’s pass rush performing a wardrobe
      malfunction on the unsuspecting Garrett. These temptresses like to wait in
      the shadows, performing ritualistic mating dances – or is that just the
      inordinate amount of leg injuries on this team keeping them from moving
      correctly? Be careful or this team might stanky leg its way into your
      heart and steal a victory.

      Well look what we have here! Yellow fixed its absentee problem and nearly
      claimed a close game over league leading Seafoam. Let’s hope Derrick can
      trick or treat more of his roster into showing up every week – if so, they
      could pull some major upsets.

      Uncut Gems defense was everywhere, they were so Julia during their game
      against Tang Bang on Sunday. Can’t say the same for their offense, as Deep
      Orange kept them Guessing and claimed their second win. Let’s see if they
      can go Spring Breakers next week or if Sympathy will be a bloody knife

      The stars and planets finally aligned for Cardinal to get its first win of
      the season over Olive, after an earlier spanking by the Navy. From my
      brief viewing of the former, it was really fun watching Logan shake and
      bake his way to two TD’s, and Thomas played some lockdown defense. You’re
      a pleasure to have in class Cardinal, and hopefully Sunday was a good
      (enough) omen for your future.

      Is a two loss day causing division within this team? Or is that just
      Wyatt’s pants tearing? Olive the talent on this roster is good, but it
      hasn’t led to enough points to win football games – just yet.

      We here at the Power Rankings appreciate the lengths to which QB Nick
      Perovich is willing to go for a victory, including wearing a cute leotard
      and tiara :) Unfortunately, it had no effect. We’re rooting for you,
      Kelly. Too much talent here to go winless.
