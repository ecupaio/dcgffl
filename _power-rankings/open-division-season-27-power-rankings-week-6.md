  Aaron S. It was my first time at the fields all season, and, well, not much
  has changed. To get everyone excited about the midseason party and our amateur
  drag hour, let’s match each team to their Drag Race counterpart!

      Hate to see Ben H atop the power rankings week-after-week. (But love this
      for Luie!) As the only undefeated team, they’re giving Bianca del Rio
      energy: quick, unbothered, withering, unchallenged, and asking every other
      team the real question:

      Twon and AJ with 51 points this weekend highlights just how fast this
      offense can move. But are we rooting for them? This team is giving Tyra
      Sanchez – they’re winning, but we’re not excited about it:

      Well, well, well, the JC crown slipped a little bit here! They put up
      quite the fight, but their ship was eventually sunk, and JC and Hoyler’s
      typically plastique demeanors were cracked. This team reminds me a bit of
      Valentina – they’re relying a lot on that body and living in their own
      fantasy! And while the mask might have stayed on during this game, I have
      a feeling a redemption arc isn’t far off.

      A team led by two girlies who always seem so close to pulling it off, but
      haven’t quite made it. We sign up for them every season because they make
      such good TV. Please welcome to the stage: Jujubee!

      About every 3 seasons or so Trainwreck steps onto Carter Barron and shows
      that he’s an old queen who’s still got it. With a fairly reliable roster,
      they might be hall of fame worthy. It’s Chad Michaels vibes all the way:

      This is a team of some pretty well known DCGFFLers–both on and off the
      field. The skill is undeniable and the reputations precede them. If you
      know gay flag football, you know these players. This is our thick ‘n
      juicy, Roxxxy Andrews team.

      I’m not sure this team is going to win it all or really knows how to put
      it all together. One thing I do know, however, is that with the star power
      of Juan, Amanda, Will, and Shane, they’re putting on a show, and we’re
      seated at The Palace for this season’s Morphine Love Dion:

      This team is a little hodgepodge, but has a lot of young charm and
      charisma. They’re .500 so far, but could turn things around to put them
      within tripping distance of the crown. I’m getting Adore Delano vibes all
      the way:

      So much pre-season buzz and promise for this W/L record. I do know this
      team is going to show up at a Get Out the Vote rally, and they’re
      definitely booked and busy each pride season, though. It’s giving Brita
      Filter.

      A blowout to the \#1 team is tough. With some uniqueness and 1 or 2
      standout performances though, I’m getting Trinity K Bonet, but will,
      ultimately, lose to an All Star.

      With some fun players and some quick comebacks, they might have it in them
      to be an All Star. They just need to escape their Florida vibes and
      elevate the taste level. It’s giving Trinity the Tuck.

      With an eclectic mix of players, it seems to be somewhat working. I think
      you get this team if it’s for you. This is very Crystal Methyd if you ask
      me.

      A team with ability but prone to meltdowns? It was so Langanja Estranja
      this weekend.

      A team that is surprising, but fighting for their lives and lipsyncing
      their way to the postseason and also kind of trade? Oh, this is Kameron
      Michaels.

      A team that kind of could have it all, but is a little delusional and
      inconsistent? I’m seeing Rosé.

      A team that is trying so hard but still with a campy verve that you either
      find fun or annoying. Let’s welcome Tina Burner to the stage:

      You know, they have an adeptness on the field but just haven’t really
      coalesced. This show (or game) isn’t for all types of talent! I bet
      they’re going to have a really successful run after this season. It’s
      giving Thorgy Thor.

      The compulsion to say this team is giving Porkchop because they remain
      winless is strong. However, Porkchop is an icon precisely because of her
      honor of being the first queen to ever be eliminated. Not so with this
      team. This team is giving Jiggly Caliente (also an icon, to be sure), but
      specifically in this outfit:
