  Tiger R. Here we are folks - one week and several silicone breast malfunctions
  later. Between the Midseason party, this weekend’s games, Gay Bowl, and
  allegations of a rigged election during the drag queen competition, there’s
  lots to report on this week. Thank you to our fabulous hosts and all our
  competition participants this year, sincerely, your football deep-state
  overlords. The fix wasn’t in from the beginning but your team is getting bonus
  points in this ranking for your service.  We’re coming to the end of the
  season so now it’s time to prove that you REALLY don’t want to play the early
  playoff game - and there’s still plenty of time for a Gay Bowl injury to throw
  even the strongest of teams for a wrench going into the playoffs. As the
  league’s resident expert on all things injuries - please come back safely and
  in one piece! Good luck to all the travel teams this coming weekend and bring
  home the title!

      Somewhere under the din of an entire league booing yet another Ben Hunt
      team leading the league, these power rankings, and to add insult to injury
      - also winning the Southwest drawing - is a not-so-small contingent
      silently cheering on a number of newer, underappreciated players getting a
      much-deserved spotlight this season. Luis continues to be the primary
      driver here - though he might need to dial it back at rush, stealing what
      would have been a pick-six for Shakka this week - but many of his
      teammates are putting up serious numbers on the scoreboard so let’s give
      them some credit.


      Good luck to Basile N., Ben H., and Luis C. in Austin, TX at Gay Bowl!

      New season, same story. Another AJ/Twon team that’s leading the league in
      points scored and eye rolls from the sidelines**.** With a handful of
      experienced players, it’s no surprise they’ve been able to hold it
      together so far this season - but we’ve seen this show before and all know
      how it ends, and it hasn’t been with the trophy in hand. Will this finally
      be the year that all changes?


      In other news, Jordan M, who decided to show-out a bit pre-birthday,
      continued to prove he’s a receiver that should never be underestimated -
      helping snag his team the W.


      Good luck to Twon H., and Bryan S. in Austin, TX at Gay Bowl! <br>

      After a soul-crushing first loss the previous week, All Tide Up came back
      to reassert their dominance on the field…only to win by 1 point over
      Orange. Has JC’s first loss in 80 years shaken his confidence or has
      Andrew Grafton been the secret sauce JC needs to win games all along? What
      rule will Hoyler have to clarify for the refs next in his emails that we
      DEFINITELY all read? Will Derrick make it to both kickball and football
      with all his fingers still intact? Find out next time.


      Good luck to Everett W., and JC A. in Austin, TX at Gay Bowl!

      I will say, for all the self-proclaimed naughtiness from this team, we the
      committee are disappointed in the distinct lack of seamen at the midseason
      party. Missed opportunities to give the Whore D'oeuvres a run for their
      money.


      &nbsp;


      In other news - Min Aura née Binder was spotted still giving full face on
      the field in her makeup from the day before. Teammate and finalist Donna
      D’Monaco could not be reached for comment as to why she didn’t do the
      same.


      Also seen - Rookie Zak showing out with several INTs and a TD to close out
      the game, and Coke getting his first score. Never underestimate the new
      guys!


      Good luck to Evan B., Alonzo M., and Cam M. in Austin, TX at Gay Bowl!<br>

      For a team this high up in the rankings, they’ve been staying fairly under
      the radar. Maybe they’re all following captain Juan’s lead as the strong
      but silent type rather than Matt Cline’s loud, in-your-face demeanor to
      make a surprise play for the trophy.


      Well-known for his sudden outbursts, Matt could be seen screaming at the
      heavens when Lime got an INT to steal the game in the final seconds for
      the second week in a row.


      Good luck to Oliver J., Juan V., Will R., and Matt C. in Austin, TX at Gay
      Bowl!

      Well, it looks like Brandon’s attempt to pay off everyone on the other
      team with fake $100 bills at the midseason party didn’t pan out. Instead,
      it seems like Saturday brunch paid a hefty price on this team the next
      morning as they couldn’t get fully organized on either side of the ball to
      stop Navy from taking the win. Maybe they should have resorted to the
      handcuffs this team was all too fond of mentioning they brought to
      Midseason.


      Good luck to Brian C., Kevin H., and Brandon M. in Austin, TX at Gay Bowl!

      This team is packed full of young talent, but with youth comes
      inexperience and with inexperience comes inconsistency. These Gayze were
      able to win a decisive victory against Black, but had a somewhat
      surprising collapse against those wiley Coyotes afterward. If Aaron can
      keep his receivers healthy going into playoffs (we’re glad you’re back
      Dawson!), they might have just enough of that youthful energy to make a
      run at the crown.


      Good luck to Morgan W., Aaron B., Bryan B., and Dawson C. in Austin, TX at
      Gay Bowl!

      Kevin and company’s relentless optimism was undercut this week by his
      team’s…we’ll call it over enthusiasm on the field. Afterward, it was hard
      to rally the troops and morale to an effective comeback. But never fear!
      This team is indomitable and, as always, was back to top form by funday
      afternoon.


      Good luck to Justin P., Shaq B., Kevin P., Paul W., Daniel H., and Gabe A.
      in Austin, TX at Gay Bowl!

      Off the field, Ryan Winter’s appearance as Robyn Summer may have surprised
      party attendees enough to earn him a spot in the final three of the
      competition much to the jealousy of his many competitors.


      On the field, attendance has often been an issue for this team, but
      they’ve fully been able to turn around their early season slump. Andre has
      been a clutch supplemental pick for this team giving them a solid
      defensive core and expanding their receiving toolkit.


      Between the fields, JJ nearly ran over a poor, defenseless mother on the
      sideline this weekend during the game. Do I get the better brother award
      now?


      Good luck to Austin A., Stephen S., Zach M., Andre B., and Ryan W. in

      This team is stacked with some of the cheeriest people in the league, but
      these pookies couldn’t quite pull it out this week after a close game
      against the Whores. Honestly, we’re just happy TJ got to choose his own
      destiny this season and it’s (partly) paying off.


      Good luck to Andrew A., Jorge M., Cedric R., Luke B., TJ C., and Brandon
      K. in Austin, TX at Gay Bowl!

      Some folks have asked me - “who is on this team” and “why are they so darn
      handsome” or “how can they be so charismatic, dreamy, athletic, and
      impressive but also approachable and relatable?” And I tell them, that’s
      the other blue team.


      But this rag-tag little clique continues to be a scrappy little team
      despite several leg-injuries and you WISH you had team patches like the
      ones we have. They’ve been slowly piecing together how best to utilize
      their players, so they could make a dark horse run for the championship
      (it’s called manifesting).


      Good luck to Charlie B., Andy A., PJ M., and Cam B. in Austin, TX at Gay
      Bowl!

      While the best performance from the team this weekend goes to Jackie
      O’Nasty (also live for this drag name), Orange just barely lost out to
      Coral - showing they’ve still got a few surprises up their \*ehem\*
      experienced sleeves. Though a key member of the team may be hurt after
      this week, so we’ll see if two weeks off is enough time to recover**.**


      I’ve been on a Waggoner/Japinga team before - and made a surprise playoff
      run for the trophy - so don’t rule them out just yet if cooler heads
      prevail…which also might be this team’s downfall.


      Good luck to Mark J., and Connor W. in Austin, TX at Gay Bowl!

      This team may not have delivered a win on the field this week but they DID
      deliver two drag performances for the adoring public this weekend, and one
      of them delivered a baby on stage at Trade. So there’s that.


      Good luck to Michael B., Andy S., Michael Z., Oriya C., and Michael O. in
      Austin, TX at Gay Bowl!

      Despite their namesake, this team has been serving tepid, at best, this
      season (other than Dwaylan giving body at all times on the field -
      coyo-teasing all of us!). They have the potential to be piping hot, but
      it’s always tough being the team to finally give win-less Kelly Green
      their first victory. However, these CoyoTEAs were able to rally to triumph
      over Purple in their second game of the day - so maybe in the spirit of
      Halloween they’re just brewing up a comeback run this season!


      Good luck to Patrick K., Dwaylan A., Mark H., and Austin P. in Austin, TX
      at Gay Bowl!

      A much-needed win at the midseason costume contest (and surprise
      appearance backup dancing - if we can call it dancing - during Jasmine’s
      number) propelled this team to secure its second win this season. This
      team has held a number of strong teams to several close games, but has a
      serious problem finishing. Maybe by the playoffs they won’t only get
      close, but finish strong.


      Good luck to Art H., Wyatt E., and Matt H. in Austin, TX at Gay Bowl!

      Despite facing a QB-less Yellow, these supernovas had a bit of a messy,
      low-scoring game as many of its receivers struggled to catch the ball this
      week. A win is still a win, but also guys, I’m looking at this roster and
      thinking…seriously, what’s going wrong?


      Good luck to Charles D., Logan D., and Jared L. in Austin, TX at Gay Bowl!

      Without their QB this week, these pokémaniacs couldn’t quite catch ‘em
      all. Instead, the Supernovas’ blockers caught Derrick’s hands as he
      continued to run over them, padding both his MVP and sack stats. It wasn’t
      enough for a win, but maybe they’ll catch a break when playoffs roll
      around and they finally have their full, talented roster to work with -
      only then can they become the champion.


      Good luck to Jordan A., Derrick J., and Marvin W. in Austin, TX at Bay
      Bowl!

      It took Nick almost two whole seasons to get another win. It’ll take them
      a whole season to think of a name (I Don’t Think You’re Ready for this
      Kelly - there you go if it hasn’t been done before). Despite their record,
      most of their losses aren’t big blowouts so that second wind could be just
      around the corner for the Team Who Must Not Be Named.


      Good luck to Levert J., Trey P., and Nick W. in Austin, TX at Gay Bowl!
