  Chris Riotta-Rogers. If you thought I was about to give you some weedy,
  ESPN-level breakdown of a gay sports league—baby, think again. This is a power
  ranking in the truest sense: an analysis based on stats, insider intel, and
  most importantly, my own god-given authority. Some of you will be mad. Some of
  you will be flattered. All of you will be talked about. So buckle up.

      **Pop Girl: Madonna**


      A step above the rest in more ways than one—**advanced, aging, and adorned
      in pearls.** This team has seen it all, done it all, and continues to do
      it better than most. Like Madge herself, their experience makes them
      dangerous, and they have no plans to let the younger girls eat. Sure,
      there’s some wear and tear, and yeah, they may need a little extra warm-up
      time, but once they start voguing, it’s over for you.

      **Pop Girl: Kylie Minogue**


      You can’t explain it. You just feel it. **Like a gay cockroach, they
      refuse to die.** Time and time again, they step onto the field, and
      suddenly, it’s **Padam Padam.** The other teams may underestimate them,
      but one well-placed pass, and you’re **screaming in the club.** The track
      record doesn’t lie: **they come back, they win, and they leave you
      gagged.**

      **Pop Girl: Chappell Roan**


      **Campy. Dramatic. Stubborn.** But also… **an underdog on the rise?** This
      team came to entertain, but they’re also **fully capable of snatching wins
      when you least expect it.** You may laugh now, but when the playoffs roll
      around? **You’ll be gagged.**

      **Pop Girl: Rihanna**


      Oh, you thought they’d just fade into the background? **Please.** Like
      Rihanna at the Super Bowl, they are **effortless, unbothered, and somehow
      still dominating.** This team is taking wins while barely breaking a
      sweat, serving confidence with a side of "Do I even need to try?" They may
      ghost the regular season, but when the playoffs roll around, they’ll be
      standing on the metaphorical Navy ship, pregnant with another
      championship.

      **Pop Girl: Beyonce**


      Houston Hometown Royalty. This team **has had to fight, claw, and sweat**
      for their flawless track record—because perfection isn’t given, it’s
      earned. Two weeks in, and they are serving **Renaissance Tour precision**
      while the rest of you struggle to hit the 8-count. Can they keep it up?
      That’s the million-dollar question. But remember: Beyoncé doesn’t lose.
      She just prepares for a comeback.

      **Pop Girl: Christina Aguilera**


      It’s giving **Dirrty.** You think they’re done? **Think again.** Just when
      you count them out, they’re **back with an entirely new face, body, and
      playbook.** This team is full of heavy hitters, powerhouse plays, and **a
      high note you can’t ignore.** The question is: can they keep the momentum,
      or will they be left in the **Back to Basics** bargain bin?

      **Pop Girl: Lorde**


      A team **teetering between brilliance and breakdown.** One moment, they’re
      serving **Pure Heroine perfection**—the next, they’re on their **Melodrama
      arc,** spiraling into **existential crisis.** They’re an undeniable
      mainstay, a guilty pleasure, and a fan favorite, but honey… these hoes
      ain’t royal **until they prove they can win when it counts.**

      **Pop Girl: Camila Cabello**


      Individually? Questionable. **As a team? Potential Top Four.** Much like
      **Fifth Harmony**, they thrive in a group effort—but when left solo, it
      gets… dicey. They’re sneaky, scrappy, and have **a sleeper-hit energy**
      about them. But are they more **"Havana" smash-hit** or **"Don’t Go Yet"
      flop?** TBD.

      **Pop Girl: Cynthia Erivo**


      A **powerful, witchy presence.** They don’t always get the glory, but you
      **do not** want to go up against them in a battle. Every week is a
      performance, every game a **Tony-winning moment.** They may not have a
      flawless track record, but their **defense is Defying Gravity.**

      **Pop Girl: Nicki Minaj**


      **Dramatic. Loud. A little chaotic.** But **undeniably legendary.** Just
      when you think they’re flopping, they **come back swinging with a
      record-breaking W.** The question isn’t whether they’ll be in the
      finals—it’s whether they’ll **self-sabotage before they get there.**

      **Pop Girl: P!nk**


      Plays **hard, goes hard, kicks ass.** But winning? **Not always a
      guarantee.** They’re here to fight, climb walls, and throw themselves into
      the game, but **can they clinch a championship, or are they just swinging
      from the rafters?**

      **Pop Girl: JoJo Siwa**


      Still figuring themselves out. **Obnoxious, unruly, unpredictable.** But
      **you can’t look away.** Whether they end up in the top rankings or an
      absolute **mess,** one thing is certain: **they will be talked about.**

      **Pop Girl: Ke$ha**


      A **comeback story in the making.** Will they rise from the ashes and
      **reclaim their throne?** Or are we all just **“Praying” for a miracle?**

      **Pop Girl: Sabrina Carpenter**


      **You espresso, but do you depresso?** The girls came **for the drama, not
      the drinks,** and **so far, you’re giving lukewarm at best.** Pick it up
      or get **left on read.**

      **Pop Girl: Nicole Scherzinger**


      The **talent is undeniable**—but much like **Pussycat Dolls**, they’re a
      **one-man show,** and it’s **holding them back.** Pass the damn ball, sis.

      **Pop Girl: Zendaya's Pop Career**


      Unfortunately, **no one asked for it.** The talent is there, but **does
      anyone actually care?**

      They **have the tools. They have the talent.** But **where are the
      results?** Everyone is **waiting for them to deliver,** but so far, it’s
      **all bass, no treble.**

      **Pop Girl: Carrie Underwood**


      **You can’t blame cheating for these losses.** Someone **smashed all four
      tires** on their season, and now **they’re praying for divine
      intervention.**
