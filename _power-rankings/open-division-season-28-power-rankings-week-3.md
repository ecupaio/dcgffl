      Leading the pack this week with a dominant performance that left their
      opponents wondering if they even showed up. Shutting out a team while
      dropping 55 points? That’s just disrespectful. Every player showed up,
      even the kicker (who somehow never misses). This team is well-disciplined,
      well-coached, and right now, well ahead of the competition.


      Final Score: 55-0


      **Dog: German Shepherd** \- Strong, intelligent, and always in control.
      They dictate the pace and dominate both sides of the ball.

      I’ll be honest, I didn’t see this team still being undefeated. But hey,
      they proved me wrong, squeezing by a young squad in a nail-biter. Was it
      their veteran savvy? Or was it the other team failing to score from inches
      away? Either way, a win’s a win, and these guys keep finding a way to get
      it done.


      Final Score: 19-18


      **Dog: Pit Bull** \- Physical, aggressive, and never backs down from a
      fight. Once they get going, stopping them is a nightmare.

      The highly anticipated game of the week did not disappoint. Citrus started
      off looking sour, but by the second half, they turned things around. The
      Oriya-Chad connection was electric, with lockdown defense and clutch
      receptions fueling an incredible comeback.


      Final Score: 27-26


      **Dog: Labrador Retriever** \- Reliable, well-rounded, and always finds a
      way to compete. Rarely has a bad game.

      All gas, no brakes. These guys had one goal: put up 50 and make it look
      easy. And they did. Every time they scored, they took the ball right back
      with an interception. The opposing team might as well have been handing
      them points.


      Final Score: 57-0


      **Dog: Husky** \- Built for endurance and speed. Flashy, fun to watch, but
      might burn out if they aren’t careful.

      This team has yet to play with a full roster, but somehow, they always
      stay in the game. Even with a depleted squad, they put on another strong
      performance. The highlight? A clutch pick-six by Jordan that sealed the
      win.


      Final Score: 42-28


      **Dog: Boxer** \- High energy and physical. Might not be the most
      strategic team, but they play hard every single game.

      Another team that decided to drop 50 this week. Every starting receiver
      got a touchdown, and even the blocking guys got some love. It was a
      full-team effort, and if they keep this up, they’ll be a real problem.


      Final Score: 54-6


      **Dog: Border Collie** \- Smart, fast, and disciplined. They might not
      look intimidating, but their skill makes them dangerous.

      Another win for Gray, and they did it with defense. Their relentless pass
      rush shut down the opposition, and they actually started catching their
      QB’s wobbly throws. A routine win for this squad.


      Final Score: 32-12


      **Dog: Golder Retriever** \- Well-liked, dependable, and always a
      contender. Does everything well, even if they don’t always get the
      recognition.

      Rolling into battle with only seven players wasn’t ideal, but they held
      their own. Fatigue caught up with them late, but Cam led a clutch
      game-winning drive. A gutsy win.


      Final Score: 34-27


      **Dog: Rottweiler** \- Tough, intimidating, and bullies you once they have
      a lead.

  - team: _teams/s28-seafoam.md
    record: 2-1
    text: >-
      A win is a win, but this one was a grind. Their endurance was tested
      against a scrappy Red team. Sanders, even while injured, made key plays.
      Overtime nearly broke them, but they found a way to pull through.


      Final Score: 40-39


      **Dog: Dalmatian** \- High energy and fun, but unpredictable. One week
      they shine, the next, they disappear.

      The young guns fought hard but couldn’t quite pull it off. They had the
      energy but just fell short.


      Final Score: 18-19


      **Dog: Bulldog** \- Scrappy, tough, and never backs down from a fight.
      It’s never easy against them.

      Came out firing, but when the smoke cleared, Citrus took the W. Even with
      an early pick-six, they couldn’t keep up in the second half.


      Final Score: 26-27


      **Dog: Doberman Pinscher** \- Fast and aggressive. If they don’t build a
      lead early, they struggle to finish.


      ![](/img/s28texasorangew3.gif){: width="480" height="256"}
  - team: _teams/s28-red.md
    record: 1-2
    text: >-
      A hard-fought battle, but their defense failed them. In OT, they had one
      job: get a stop. They didn’t.


      Final Score: 39-40


      **Dog: Greyhound** \- Speed is their game. If they get ahead, they’re
      lethal. If they fall behind, it may be over.

      Held strong until the second half, then Sushi Gang sent them packing. A
      tough loss, but they can bounce back fast.


      Final Score: 28-42


      **Dog: Corgi** \- Undersized but full of heart. Plays bigger than they
      are, but struggles against the best.

      Another week, another loss. At this point, they just need to beat
      somebody. Anybody. Please.


      Final Score: 12-32


      **Dog: Beagle** \- Always sniffing around for a win but rarely finds one.
      Plays with enthusiasm but lacks the strength to pull through.

  - team: _teams/s28-sand.md

      This team has potential but seems lost. Maybe some team therapy is needed.


      Final Score: 27-34


      **Dog: Chihuahua** \- All bark, no bite. Talks big, plays with energy, but
      gets overpowered.


      ![](/img/s28sandw3.gif){: width="364" height="402"}
  - team: _teams/s28-carolina.md
    record: 0-3
    text: >-
      The pieces are there, but they just can’t seem to put it together.


      Final Score: 6-54


      **Dog: Basset Hound** \- Slow, sluggish, and doesn’t seem too interested
      in winning.


      ![](/img/s28carolinaw3.gif){: width="480" height="480"}
  - team: _teams/s28-cardinal.md

      Took a brutal 50-point loss. Feels like they’re in full rebuild mode.

      Final Score: 0-55

      **Dog: Poodle** \- Tries to look flashy but isn’t built for tough games.

      ![](/img/s28cardinalw3.gif){: width="480" height="480"}
  - team: _teams/s28-woodland-brown.md

      Didn’t know it was possible to throw that many interceptions. Swapped QBs
      and somehow got worse. But hey, their actual QB was missing, so they get a
      pass (ironically, unlike their QBs).


      Final Score: 0-57


      **Dog: Pug** \- Struggles to keep up, outmatched in every category. It’s
      been a rough season.
