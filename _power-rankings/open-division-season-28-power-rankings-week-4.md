  Tiger R. As I sit here typing these with one less functional finger,
  seasonally sacrificed to the Gods of Carter Barron, I wonder…who will be next?
  And will they need me to bring more tape and Advil to the fields?  We’re
  halfway through the season so now the knife fight to avoid the play-in game
  begins. May the odds be ever in your favor.

      As the dull murmur of “ugh, not another straight quarterback” has started
      to grow louder with each passing week, this team remains my very unbiased
      pick for top of the league. Despite what their team name suggests, these
      pearls have continued to pull it out each weekend.


      They may be benefiting from 3 opposing QBs conveniently being out of town
      the first 5 weeks of their football schedule but THEY’RE REALLY GOOD I
      PROMISE.


      It’s giving…rigged by the commissioner.

      I’m giving this team the silent but deadly award for remaining the only
      other undefeated team but doing it so casually and quietly - like the many
      DL masc bros we all know too well. But avast! There be stormy seas ahead.
      Most of their games have remained fairly close, so it’s only a matter of
      time before this ship hits the rocks and sinks - or their deep, intensely
      personal secret is discovered!


      It’s giving…headless torso pic.

      According to all who observed, this game was UG-LY. About 1,000 penalties
      later, these boys and girls were able to eek out a win after both sides
      were thoroughly annoyed with each other and the refs. In other news, it
      seems age is finally catching up to JC as there’s ALWAYS something wrong
      with his arm whenever he throws the ball straight into the grass instead
      of his receivers.


      Honorable mention to Zach M for being the biggest cheerleader for his team
      but also for nearly becoming the first forever family member in league
      history to have refs throw a flag on him. (No, they can’t actually do
      that…right?)


      It’s giving…nobody fucking with my clique.

      This team might need to go into business together and open up a restaurant
      because these sushi rolled all over Cardinal this weekend. While they are
      all too excited to explain what their name means to anyone who will listen
      to show they know \*relatively\* modern references - they’re also proving
      that raw may be, in fact, better.


      It’s giving…staying relevant.

      This lean, green, fighting machine has quietly climbed up these rankings
      one week at a time. After knocking Neon Yellow off the top perch in their
      division, they’ll be looking to claim the top spot for themselves next
      weekend in a match against Royal - who is also sporting a 3-1 record. They
      will also attempt to avoid being told to turn their music down by families
      at the kids playground.


      It’s giving…noise violation.

      To the casual passerby, this game could have easily been confused for a
      casual pickup game between friends for how chill and uneventful it was for
      the majority of the playtime. Given their roster, this is actually not
      surprising in the slightest. Just a bunch of chill dudes. Though they also
      politely request to never play on field 4 again. Ever.


      It’s giving…intramural.

      A controversial block on their last offensive drive of the game turned an
      already tight match into a screaming match between the aristocracy and the
      peasants in Orange. Undeterred, the ruling class made sure that the
      naysayers were subsequently and swiftly dealt with before it could go any
      further. And yet again, the oligarchy reigned supreme.


      It’s giving…top of Bernie Sanders’ hit list.

      With a valiant effort and a near game-winning drive at the end, this train
      was not a wreck but did not become unstoppable this weekend. (Though they
      did stop my pinky from functioning..) Several great catches by Juan and
      Kevin kept the momentum up on offense - and while they never derailed on
      defense they just barely got outsped by their opponents.


      It’s giving…dark horse.

      A poem for the cultured among us:

      &nbsp;

      This team maintained a contested game

      With long offensive drives.

      Until they were stopped. By who? By the lot…

      Those monarchs in front of the goal line.

      &nbsp;

      “Oh, no, no, no” said those pesky queens,

      “only THESE hoes get to reign supreme.”

      Orange tried to protest, but were forced to stay pressed

      When they were suddenly shoved aside.

      &nbsp;

      It’s giving…maintaining the status quo.

      Carried by the birthday boy himself, these bottoms came out on top this
      weekend. By the end of the second half, they took full ownership of those
      Apricocks like it was their job. But it takes two to tango so they could
      also be seen later at Shakers in various states of lucidity after their
      team brunch with Neon Orange.


      It’s giving…\*power\* bottoms.

      Weighed down by low turnout and a few hangovers, the Apricocks found they
      couldn’t keep up the energy for the full game. They did, however, find
      plenty of energy to go to brunch afterward.


      It’s giving…priorities.

      Struggling with a fairly uneven performance so far this season, the
      Foamboys faced yet another setback by handing Sand their first win of the
      season. However, I expect one week off will give them enough fo(a)mo that
      they’ll earn another big W come next weekend.


      It’s giving…inconsistency.

      OK, I have heard next to nothing about this team all season. I’ve barely
      even SEEN most of this team. Where y’all at? Are you alive? Did you forget
      to wear your Life Alert?

      With both Purple and Carolina looking to snag their first win this week,
      the Modest Expectations were able to pull through and get their first W.
      Brandon was seen holding down the Managing Expectations’ defense and as
      usual Austin was dashing around to keep the Living Up to Expectations’
      victory hopes alive. While the championship may seem out of reach right
      now for the Unrealistic Expectations, there is still time for them to
      evolve into the Exceeds Expectations and make a surprise run in the end.


      It’s giving…fine wine.

      I can’t relate to desperation but fresh off a talented supplemental pick,
      the coffee connoisseurs were hoping to secure their first win this
      weekend. They didn’t quite achieve that but they did show they still have
      some fight in them, holding Gray to a closer game than their last. Maybe a
      tad more caffeine will finally jolt them to a victory?

      On paper, this team should be so solid but they haven’t been able to lock
      in so far this season, with the only points in the first half of the game
      coming off Andre running back an INT during a conversion. By the time the
      second half rolled around it was far too late to mount a comeback.


      It’s giving…back injury.

      After a leisurely honeymoon away (which looked fabulous btw!), Brandon was
      so excited to return to football without having to quarterback for the
      first time since the Stone Ages. Instead, he looked like he was still on
      vacation as he got sacked numerous times by Coral’s rush. Whenever this
      team does a full-scale audit, I hope they start to embody more of the
      “wrath” part of their namesake and less of the “sloth” part.


      It’s giving…child picking flowers on the field.
