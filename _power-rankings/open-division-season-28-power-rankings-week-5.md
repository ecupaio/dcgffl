      A forfeit isn’t the most impressive result to justify \#1 in the Power
      Rankings, but as the only remaining undefeated team, White Load-Us has
      earned this slot. Lots of weapons on this team and a roster that bounces
      back when crazy shenanigans are happening around them.


      This team reminds me of…Victoria Ratliff: This team has been like a
      tsunaaamiiii this season, overwhelming the competition. Hopefully they can
      stay off the Lorazepam and finish the season strong.

      Forest Green has been pummeling teams the past several weeks behind an
      unstoppable offensive onslaught. At this point, the only team who seems
      like they can stand in their way is themselves.


      This team reminds me of…Laurie: Episode 1 she seemed like she was the odd
      one out, but by the end of the season she was warming our hearts and
      leading her friends to a happy ending. After a tumble out of the window
      during Week 2, the Emerald Edgers have been on fire.

  - team: _teams/s28-coral.md
    record: 4-1
    text: >-
      Coral has been quietly destroying teams this season with a workmanlike
      attitude that will make them a tough out in the playoffs. A firm drubbing
      of previously undefeated Navy should put the rest of the league on notice.


      This team reminds me of… Kate. She seems sweet, but she’s keeping secrets
      and will reveal them to knock you out when you aren’t ready for it.

      After scraping by winless Brown last week, Iron Gray regained their
      footing this week with a solid two-touchdown win. A close first half gave
      way to a dominant second period that left little doubt as to the outcome.


      This team reminds me of… Belinda: She had to fight for herself all season
      but in the end she was left with $5 million in the bank. Not too shabby.

      Avast, Navy’s run as an undefeated team finally ran aground – and by 40
      points, no less. Is it a fluke, or has the treasure chest been emptied?
      We’ll see if they can right the ship next week against a seaworthy Neon
      Yellow squad.


      This team reminds me of…Chelsea: She was a fan favorite all season who was
      tragically slaughtered at the end.

  - team: _teams/s28-black.md

      Black proved their mettle this week by going toe-to-toe with a very tough
      Neon Yellow squad and gritting out a one-point win. Jim has had a solid
      season at QB, spreading the love to several receivers. Shoutout to Juan
      for pulling down a one-handed catch this week that had the sideline
      whooping.


      This team reminds me of…Sritala: Much like certain stars on this team, age
      is no object for our queen, who uses her accumulated knowledge and sharp
      senses to take you down.

  - team: _teams/s28-neon-yellow.md
    record: 3-2
    text: >-
      This is a really quality team that has dropped two very close games
      against tough teams. Oriya and Chad have been carrying this team on the
      score sheet, but their success has been a group effort as many players
      have stepped up with solid play.


      This team reminds me of…Mook: Mook is kind, maybe a little sassy, but
      otherwise just very pleasant. Just when it seemed like she could be a
      secret villain, it turns out she was willing to give a nice guy like
      Gaitok a chance.

    record: 3-2
    text: >-
      Seafoam has been playing on the edge all season, with close wins and close
      losses defining their play as a team. A palate-cleansing win against
      Cardinal this week may be just what they needed to bust out of their slump
      from last week.


      This team reminds me of…Saxon Ratliff: This team is a little unpredictable
      and has a certain swagger that makes me feel like they would enjoy a
      protein shake. Don’t read too much into it, I had to cover all the main
      characters.

      Red kept marching along this week with a close win over winless Carolina.
      There was high drama in this one, as Carolina looked like they could to
      seal the deal but Red broke their hearts with a late TD and a painfully
      close goal line stop to seal the win.


      This team reminds me of…Pam. Doesn’t make too much noise all season, but
      then pops up to read you down and throw you off your game.

    text: >-
      A week after Royal pulled into a first place tie in their division, Forest
      laid the lumber on this team and knocked them down the standings. Royal
      has been streaky this season, if they want to contend for a title they’ll
      need to find their early season form again.


      This team reminds me of…Chloe. She’s a bad b\*tch who can get stuff done
      but gets herself tangled up in other people’s drama.

      A back and forth affair with Woodland Brown provided high dramatics this
      week. Refs were called in from far and wide to adjudicate the rules in a
      tense battle that gave everyone heartburn.


      This team reminds me of…Gaitok: Much like our lovable security guard, this
      team started the season away from the gate with three straight losses. But
      after two straight wins, could their hero arc be starting?

    text: >-
      Had to forfeit, which happens to the best of us but pulls this team down
      in the standings. Maybe not the best timing, with undefeated White up
      next.


      This team reminds me of…Valentin. He was a big part of the girl trio plot
      for most of the season, and then more or less ghosted us in the finale.

  - team: _teams/s28-texas-orange.md
    record: 2-3

      Some inspired defensive play from Texas Orange led to a 7-7 tie at the
      half, but ultimately it was turnovers and losing track of some receivers
      on deep routes that led to a two-score loss. At one point in the second
      half Texas could have tied it, but a key interception at the goal line
      swung the momentum.


      This team reminds me of…Jaclyn: The fateful interception caused a certain
      unnamed player to kick an equipment bag on the sideline and then it
      immediately started pouring rain. Kinda like when Jaclyn got doused with a
      squirt gun at the Songkran Water Festival and made it everyone else’s
      problem.

  - team: _teams/s28-sand.md
    record: 2-3
    text: >-
      Sand seems to have found some more stable footing this week, mercy ruling
      Pink on the strength of a very solid outing from AJ.


      This team reminds me of…Lochlan Ratliff: Quiet, not making too much noise,
      and then does something that makes everyone say “where did that come
      from??” Just stay away from the blender, boys.

  - team: _teams/s28-carolina.md

      This team has so much talent and has played very close in most of their
      games this season, so I can’t rank them in the cellar just yet. By all
      accounts the big plays have just been offset by costly mistakes. This is
      still a team that I wouldn’t count out.


      This team reminds me of…Timothy Ratliff. Too many unforced errors and
      sleepwalking through portions of games resemble some of the more subdued
      episodes from the Ratliff patriarch.

      Tough week for Pink, who has hung in there but has some work to do to
      rebound from a four-game losing streak. At least we know this team will
      have strong attendance at Shakers. Shoutout to rookie Patrick for being
      one of this team’s leading scorers so far.


      This team reminds me of…Piper Ratliff. Started out with some promise in
      Week 1, but by the end we realize Piper is just as damaged as the rest of
      them.

      On-field accounts report that Brian Hotchkiss said he “forgot how to play
      football for two drives” which, when coming from your QB, doesn’t bode
      well for success. This team has kept it close in all of its games but it
      has yet to lead to a victory.


      This team reminds me of…Pornchai: He’s likable and gets so close to
      fulfilling his dream, only to have his hopes dashed by Belinda. Here’s
      hoping this team can open their own mud spa someday.

      I’m holding out hope for Cardinal to surprise someone this season. When
      asked who won between Cardinal and Seafoam, sources say captain Evan
      Binder replied “take a wild guess” which is not a great place to be at
      this point. Hopefully adding veteran Brandon Waggoner to the roster may
      help them turn the corner. Also want to call out some very solid rookie
      play from this team, which could be the difference in securing an upset
      first round playoff win.


      This team reminds me of…Rick Hatchett: A pretty tough watch all season and
      then died after picking a fight he couldn’t win. I’ll leave it there.
