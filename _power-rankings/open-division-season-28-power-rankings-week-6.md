      Another week at the top for White Load-us. The season finale of the show
      may have been last week, but this team is still rolling. They played a
      back and forth game in the first half, but an injury for Red just before
      halftime set them back. White steamrolled Red, 40-14.


      This team is: Bari, Italy. By far the best city in the best European
      country. From the beaches, to the food, to the wine, Bari has it all. And
      you gotta wear white in Italy.

      With Aaron and his cannon, slinging the ball around for another week, they
      are knocking on the door to being in the top spot


      This team is: San Diego, CA. Would be number one, but for almost the same
      flight time, you could be in Italy.

      With a come from behind win vs. Sand, the Sushi Gang was buzzing. Will
      they continue their streak after the bye week?


      This team is Los Angeles, CA. High levels of drama all around. Is it for
      real? Is it fake? Only time and injections will tell.

      A high drama game where the last play turned the tide for Navy.


      This team is: Las Vegas, NV. It's always there, you know what to expect,
      but it will still sneak up on you.

      Another team missing their starting QB (Hoops star?? Cam McPhereson), they
      were able to get the W with Jack Loome at the helm. Will there be a new
      knighting ceremony?


      This team is: London, England. A lot of kings and queens on this squad.
      Can they take the crown?

      Down a QB, Alex David stepped up to try and will his team to a victory vs
      Royal Blue. But it was futile. Sources say both teams agreed to tackle
      football instead of flag.


      This team is: Edinburgh, Scotland. Almost London, but not.

      Even a kick return for a TD couldn't stop the waves Navy was bringing.
      Oriya and Alonzo tried their best, but the ships stayed docked at the
      port.


      This team is: Ocean City, NJ. Way better than Ocean City MD. A great time
      can be had if everyone would just coordinate.

      Multiple TD’s from Zak, Kevin and Juan looked to be the answer for a
      second consecutive week. But, with a late game turnover, returned for 60
      yards, the Cockus came up short.


      This team is Miami, FL. Feast or Famine. You either have the best nights
      of your life or spend 48 hours arguing with your friends. No in between.

      Down by 2 scores late in the game, missing Honeycutt, Texas stormed back
      to beat Black who has been on the come up in recent weeks.


      This team is…you guessed it….Austin, TX. A totally underrated city that is
      always a good time. Watch out.

      In the first half, Red held their own vs. the best city in the world.
      Having them believe anything is possible.


      This team is: New York City. City of dreams, but that's just what it
      is….dreams.

      Despite a chaotic Coral on the other side of the ball, Sand was unable to
      put down a giant in the making.


      This team is: Philadelphia, PA. A whole lot of rushers, but once you get
      some CB’s you become a Superbowl Champ. Go Birds!

      Facing a depleted Pink team, they took care of business.


      This team is: Pittsburgh, PA. A hard working city that brings their lunch
      pal. But you might not want to vacation there.

      When you beat the last place team, it's whatever.

      This team reminds me of: Scranton, PA. It’s whatever

      Lost to the rising Forrest Green. Didn't have enough strength.


      This team reminds me of: Arlington, VA. Not enough to be DC or Old Town
      Alexandria.

      Despite having a measly six players, Pink almost had the upset of the week
      vs. Seafoam. If they can put together a full squad, they might actually
      have a chance.


      This team reminds me of: Wilmington, DE. Put it together and you could be
      Philly.

      Got a win despite not playing a single minute.

      This team is: Chapel Hill, NC. They know they are better than Raleigh.

      You forfeit, you drop.


      This team reminds me of Raleigh, NC. Very Similar to Chapel Hill, but
      everyone knows it's worse.

      Another week, another loss. I think they will pull out a victory here very
      soon. Scott Graham is back, so their fearless leader Evan Binder will
      rally the troops this week.


      This team is: Meadowlands, NJ. Home of the New York Jets. Is it NYC? No.
      Does it have Italians? Yes. Does it want to be Bari? Yes.
