  JC Adams. Wow - what an end to the regular season.  Thank you Light Blue &
  Black for closing it out with a very entertaining double overtime game.  As
  you all know, I ranked all of the teams in my Preseason Power Rankings.  Let’s
  recap this season to see which teams performed to and above expectations and
  which teams just flat out embarrassed themselves, and me, for believing in
  you.

      *Preseason Ranking: 11*


      Light Blue has dominated all season and there’s no denying that. They have
      basically blown out every single team. Kristin L. has thrown 37 touchdowns
      (18 to Jordan A. and 11 to captain Michael B.). BUT did Black of all teams
      (I know I’m shocked too) show the league the blueprint to stopping this
      team after taking Blue to double OT last weekend? Even so, I don’t see any
      of the teams in Light Blue’s quadrant stopping them from the Final 4. I
      think this team dominates this weekend and won’t be tested until
      championship week.


      <br>*Additional Note*: QB Kristin will potentially be playing FOUR games
      back to back to back to back between Open & Women’s+ division if she
      continues to win. If she pulls this off and leads both of her teams to
      championship weekend…G.O.A.T.

      *Preseason Ranking: 1*


      Royal is surging. They have won 5 straight games to close the season and
      are ready to take that momentum into the playoffs. Statistically, this is
      the most balanced offensive team with five players bringing in 3 or more
      TDs this season. JC Adams (yes, me) has the highest TD to INT ratio in the
      league and if this team can continue to win the turnover battle they can
      easily see themselves in the final 4. Watch out though, it looks like
      there could be a huge clash in the 2nd round for this team against the
      winner of Forest/Kelly after Royal’s warm up game vs Black in the 1st
      round.

      *Preseason Ranking: 5*


      Pink has been an unpredictable team all season. You never know what you’re
      going to get. They could beat a team by 30 one week, get beat by 30 the
      next, lose to a team without their starting QB in the final weekend, you
      just never know! While this team has won enough games to claim the \#2
      seed, in large part due to a breakout season by Ademola A. who is top five
      in the league with 80 points this season, one concerning stat is that they
      have the LOWEST extra point conversion percentage in the entire league at
      an embarrassing 31.71%. They have only converted 13 XPs all season! Is it
      maybe because the QB can’t see over his offensive line? Is his age
      catching up? IDK. I pray this team makes the final four though (for
      personal reasons only).

      *Preseason Ranking: 8*


      Cardinal is an offensive powerhouse. They are scoring an astonishing 39+
      points per game. AJ Reust has accounted for 47 touchdowns and MVP front
      runner Juan Varela has what I believe to be a league record 29 TDs in one
      season, which is over 3 TDs per game. Insane. Should we double team him
      or?? This team however does have a tough road to make it to the final 4
      and will have to be on their best behavior to get there. Can you imagine
      what this team will do to each other if they lose this weekend? I kind of
      want to see it.

      *Preseason Ranking: 2*


      Forest - although they have surely had some ups and downs this season - is
      still one of my dark horse teams to win it all. This team has
      underperformed nearly all season, which has awarded them 2 tough games vs
      Kelly and, most likely, Royal to make it to the final four. Forest will
      need to score every possession on offense since it’s highly unlikely their
      defense is going to help them. I thought you all had a former defensive
      MVP on the team? Can Commissioner Cam’s golden arm and balanced offensive
      attack led by Joey H., who leads all rookies at ninth in the league with
      62 points (in just five games!), and Brian H. (8 TDs??) help them advance
      to next weekend? Hopefully not.

  - team: _teams/s29-seafoam.md
    record: 5-4

      *Preseason Ranking: 7*


      Seafoam finished the season strong with a narrow win over Kelly Green to
      secure the \#2 seed in their division for the playoffs. This team has a
      lot of talented players, with four players – Jamal L., Austin P., and Zak
      S. – eclipsing the 40 point mark for the season and with defensive captain
      Justin Parker at the helm. I can easily see them sneaking into the final
      4.


      But I need to drag my friend Austin (QB) for a moment. TWENTY SIX (26)
      sacks taken. For context, the 2nd worst team in this category was only
      sacked 15 times! What is going on? Are you reading a few chapters of your
      book before attempting to throw the ball? Sending a few work emails back
      in the pocket? Gazing into Pedro’s eyes on the sideline instead of
      focusing on your receivers? Or should we throw the offensive line under
      the bus? Sister Logan, where are you? One thing I know, this team better
      clean up whatever is going on here — QUICKLY.

      *Preseason Ranking: 15*


      Kelly Green, led by rookie QB Matt R. and a very impressive veteran season
      by Kevin H. (third in the league in points with 97, fifth in the league in
      sacks with 7), faces off against Forest round 1. Quite the opposite from
      Seafoam, Matt has only taken 2 sacks all season which can be attributed to
      his quick release style offense and a Blocker of the Season-worthy
      performance from Kobie C. This team has it all - weapons on both sides of
      the ball, a cool calm and collected QB, and two of the sassiest twinks in
      the DCGFFL that strike fear into all of our hearts. HOWEVER, leading
      receiver Kevin will be out of office championship weekend. If this team
      manages to make it to the final 4, will their offense continue to thrive
      without him?

      *Preseason Ranking: 3*


      This team is the definition of “what could have been”. They have lost
      nearly half of their team due to injuries, and have only played a total of
      2 games with their original starting QB, Oriya. I am pretty sure nearly
      every player has had to play multiple positions all season due to their
      constant lack of numbers at games. This team definitely has the heart and
      the will to win as they still somehow managed to finish above .500 and
      claim the \#3 seed in their division. I mean they literally won a game
      with 6 players on the field for 90% of the game. Shoutout to Luie & Daniel
      for stepping in at QB and keeping this team’s championship dreams alive.
      It truly will take 2 heroic performances back to back for this squad to
      advance to the final 4.

      *Preseason Ranking: 6*


      Coral is slipping - they have dropped 3 of their last 4 games and have
      given up nearly 40 points in 4 games straight. Their defense has been
      non-existent all season. Aaron isn’t helping either with his 60 yard, one
      play TD bombs that put his exhausted defense right back on the field.


      On the bright side, Jordan M. and Brian W. have stepped up big time on
      offense in captain Morgan’s absence from his ankle injury. Jordan has
      brought in 14 TDs and most improved Brian W. has brought in another 10
      TDs; with both finishing in the top 10 in the league in points to lead the
      offense. Rumor has it that Morgan will be making a comeback for playoffs
      which may be exactly what this team needs to turn this around…until he
      re-injures his ankle (kidding - please don’t hurt yourself again!). If
      this team can get a stop on defense, they just might surprise people and
      squeeze out two wins and advance to the final 4.

      *Preseason Ranking: 4*


      Orange finished their season strong, winning 4 of their last 5 games to
      finish with an above .500 record. This team will be without their starting
      QB Ben H. this weekend and the reins have been handed over to former
      champion QB Ms. Brenda Waggoner. Brenda has the championship experience
      yes, but it has been quite some time since I have seen her throw a
      football.


      This is another team that will have to make the most out of one of their
      star players Brandon R. – who added some defense (5 INTs) to his offense
      (76 points) – this weekend before he goes wherever he is going next
      weekend. Veterans Marvin W. and Andy A. will need to carry this squad this
      weekend to buy this team one more weekend for Ben to return.

      *Preseason Ranking: 16*


      Sapphire is on fire. They have won 3 straight games and went from league
      worst to \#5 seed in their division in the blink of an eye. QB Chris D. is
      feeling himself and becoming more comfortable leading the offense every
      week. This team has an insane roster with AJ, Michael A., TJ (new DC
      resident!), Everett, and Brandon leading the way.


      I can’t be TOO nice though. This team is statistically the lowest scoring
      offense in the league right now, putting up 168 points this season (coming
      up almost 30 points shy of Juan alone….). Granted, they had two forfeits,
      but they will either need to keep up their recent momentum on offense or
      continue to rely on their defense to keep them in games.

      *Preseason Ranking: 14*


      I thought I may have been wrong about this team mid way through the season
      as they started with a 3-2 record, however they seem to be falling apart
      as they have dropped 4 straight games. The offense has been decent, with
      Bryan Burke leading in TDs with 8 and Trey putting together an
      MVP-candidate performance with 7 TDs and a league-leading 15 sacks.
      However, this team has struggled to put together a game where they play
      well on both sides. I’m predicting a first round exit against Seafoam on
      Sunday.

      *Preseason Ranking: 12*


      Can QB Andre pull off another miracle in the first round again and knock
      off another major contender? I think it’s possible. This team has a strong
      roster and has shown they can win when all things are clicking. Paul W.,
      Chad H., and Mark J. have all scored 6 touchdowns each. This team is
      giving upset alert against \#3 seed Cardinal.

      *Preseason Ranking: 10*


      The good news? Some of their veteran receivers are warming up and back in
      vintage form. The bad news? Iron simply has just not played well all
      season. They look tired. Their offense has struggled to connect and their
      only 2 wins are coming against teams that have a combined 6 wins on the
      season. I think it’s pretty safe to say that this team will not be making
      it past the dominant Light Blue squad. At least you all will have time for
      your mid day nap before Sunday Funday at Shakers!

      Although I have this team at \#15 due to their record, I don’t believe
      they are actually that bad. Most of their games have come down to one
      possession and they showed that they haven’t given up yet with a near
      upset of the season, double OT thriller against Light Blue last week.
      Injuries have also held this team back. This team does have a very tough
      match up against Royal Blue in round 1 this weekend, with the Ricchetti
      brothers facing off 1 on 1 to claim the title of the most athletic
      brother.


      And Josh E. has shown us what a real comeback season looks like, claiming
      5 MVPs and tying for fourth in the league with 5 INTs. I believe kickball
      season is over as well, so we know you’ll have at least one additional
      player showing up to playoffs this time around. (iykyk)

      “My biggest pet peeve is incompetence” - Anonymous player on Gold (Chris
      Riotta- Rogers)


      Wrapping up this season’s Power Rankings - I unfortunately have to put
      Gold at \#16. This is a team I truly believe has no chance to upset their
      opponent. They have lost their star player Nick W, they are 2nd worst in
      offensive points per game, they are league worst in forced turnovers on
      defense, and I can’t count how many deep sighs I have heard on this team’s
      sideline. Maybe a little too much of throwing into triple coverage? Matt H
      and Art H are playing hard and Alex D has tried to keep this team afloat
      at the cone position, giving up only three sacks all season (second lowest
      in the league), even while playing several games with backup quarterbacks.


      This team has a good roster but has just not been able to put it together.
      At least they are one of the more fun teams on Sunday Funday! Vinny - I’ll
      see you later for tequila shots.
