  by Reed B. The Regular Season has officially sashayed away! Sorry to all the
  would-be queens crying at home dreaming of what could have been and those who
  packed a cute look but couldn't serve the goods. Now it's time for the Final
  Four to prove they are the true all-stars. They are all just one win away from
  the final Lip Sync for the Crown. Good luck, and show us what you've got.

      Light Blue’s dominance is unassailable. They are undefeated against every
      team in the Final Four they have faced, including a high-scoring, but
      decisive 42-31 Week 2 win over their semi-final opponent, Cardinal. QB
      Kristin L. showed legendary stamina by clocking an ~ *unbelievable* ~ four
      straight playoff games last week. That's the definition of committing to
      the fantasy. She is chasing herstory, as a win would make her the first
      female QB champion of the DCGFFL open division. We know this semi-final is
      a rematch, and the only question is whether Cardinal has an updated look
      for the runway. Light Blue needs only to maintain their signature polish.
      They just need to keep their eyes on the prize and remember: *"You're a
      winner, baby."*

      Cardinal possesses immense offensive talent, but their defense has been
      clocked all season. They suffered two rough losses to teams in the final
      four (42-31 to Light Blue in Week 2 and 50-19 to Pink in Week 7). Now,
      they face Light Blue again in a mandatory redemption arc. Their scoring
      ability is fierce, but the tea is *their defense must deliver.* They need
      to demonstrate the nerve to challenge the league's top team and prove they
      can overcome those past defensive lapses to deliver a flawless
      performance.This is their final chance to prove they were underestimated
      nearly all season; we will be watching for a legendary look…

      Frankly, there is a case to be made that Royal should be our \#2 queen.
      This talented team has proven they know how to win a tight set, with two
      clutch one-point victories (32-31 and 30-29 in back-to-back weeks late in
      the season). They outlasted all the other Shakers Division teams; however,
      are the whispers and rumors true 👀? QB JC Adams' potential hamstring
      injury could limit their ceiling, forcing them in these rankings to the
      \#3 spot. They now face Pink in a semi-final that will be a dramatic
      showdown – possibly the best game of the playoff. This team's heart is
      huge and they are undoubtedly tacticians, so they must leave the drama and
      the rumors backstage. Ignore the shade, serve the final look, and clinch
      the crown.

      Pink were the Pitchers Division runner-ups, two games behind Light Blue.
      QB Wyatt E. is aiming for an incredible second straight title. They are
      capable of slaying the biggest queens, proven by their mercy rule of Gold
      last week and a stunning, decisive 50-19 demolition of Cardinal in Week 7.
      Only misstep from the first leg of the playoffs is their potentially
      chaotic energy that led to a few sloppy turnovers, but their talent across
      positions is undeniable. If they can stick the landing, this semi-final
      against Royal is just a pit stop on their way to history, and they could
      absolutely *gag* the entire bracket. Remember: "We're all born naked, and
      the rest is drag." Now go make some history.
