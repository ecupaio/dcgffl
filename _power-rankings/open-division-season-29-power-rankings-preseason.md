  JC Adams. Season 29 is here, and the DCGFFL looks completely different.  A new
  commissioner has taken the reins, rosters have been chosen, and for the first
  time in years, we will kick off without some of the league’s cornerstone &
  veteran QBs - Cline, Waggoner, Bryan S. & Hotchkiss.  Their absence however
  leaves room for new stars to emerge.  Welcome new QBs Chris D. and Matt R.! 
  Please don’t embarrass yourselves. See below for some PRE-SEASON Power
  Rankings.

      How could I not rank our team as \#1? 1st-time captain Dawson C. looks to
      take his squad all the way. This team is loaded with talent and has one of
      the deepest rosters in the league. This team’s only downfall is that
      league photographer Dave A. will be busy playing in their games instead of
      snapping photos of them on the field. Expect to see Royal posing for
      action shots pre & post game for our instas.

      This team looks to be an early favorite to win it all. Commissioner & QB
      Cam M. has many, many weapons at his disposal including rookie Ethan S.,
      Drew C., Zach G., and the Hoyler brothers. Will Captain Andrew get jealous
      though when his brother gets more targets than him and bring the team
      crashing down? Will he appoint long time QB Brian Hotchkiss as the new
      starting QB to “fix” the problem? Only time will tell.

      This team has the roster and talent to go all the way. Another well
      drafted squad by the poppers king, 2X defensive MVP & Captain Luie will go
      as far as their QB Oriya C. takes them. After coming back from a tough
      injury last season in the final 4, will Oriya be able to return back to
      normal form? The team sure has the supporting cast to do so. One thing we
      can count on is this team smelling like fireball and poppers post game at
      Shakers. (You know who you are.)

      A Ben H.-led team is almost a guarantee to make the final 4 every season
      and I do not think that changes this season either. This team has multiple
      weapons on offense to get them there, Brandon R., Andy A., Marvin W.—
      however they will need to win on offense alone because I am not sure who
      is going to play defense on this squad. Maybe defending champion captain
      Jens can figure out a way to put a defense together to keep this team
      balanced.

      Defending champion & short king QB William Wyatt Eck had one of the
      greatest playoff performances in known DCGFFL history last season and
      looks to prove it wasn’t a fluke. This appears to be a well rounded team
      led by league vet Alonzo M. - however rumor has it that both their QB and
      star Chad M. will be missing 3+ games which could affect their playoff
      seeding. I do know that pastry chef Patrick B. will (hopefully) be baking
      up some tasty treats throughout the season and I WILL be stopping by this
      team's sideline each week.

      WARNING: If you are a receiver on this team, say goodbye to your fingers,
      because QB Aaron B. simply does not care about them. Think 100 mph fast
      ball coming straight at you. Hopefully you all drafted a team that can
      catch them. This team does have some good talent though with “The Summer I
      Turned Pretty”-obsessed Jordan M., rookie Luke A., and league vet Daniel
      B. 3rd-time captain Morgan is looking refreshed after his week long Italy
      trip and is ready to make a run in the playoffs. Watch out for this team -
      no actually - be careful and don’t take your eyes off the ball!

      This team has by far the nicest and most friendly roster in the league
      (except for Rob). You literally can’t hate this team and I have nothing
      mean to say. With ex-commish Logan D. and everyone’s favorite teammate
      Austin P. leading the way, this team will have peak vibes win or lose and
      will be high in demand for team mixers. This is an early dark horse team
      and I believe they have the roster to have a very successful season.

      This team has a lot of ….personality….. Captain Juan & QB AJ R. both have
      championship experience and I am VERY curious to see how this team shakes
      out. Will this team be able to stick together if things don’t go as
      planned? Will AJ’s “run around and get open” model work for this group?
      Will Juan ever be able to beat the captain crash-out allegations? I think
      this team finishes middle of the pack and averages a minimum of two
      crash-outs per game this season.

      This team is led by QB Mark H. and Tiger R., and I think it’s time to
      introduce a new stat: IPG (Injuries Per Game) - with a combined total of
      37 injuries in the past 5 seasons between the 2, let’s just pray they make
      it through the season. Maybe that’s why they decided to draft the star
      center/cone duo of Kenny J. & Mike Z. for extra protection. This team does
      have a solid roster though with Josh E. looking to have a bounceback MVP
      worthy season, Nick J. returning for his 3rd season and veterans like
      Austin A. & Aubrie holding down the fort. I expect this team to finish in
      the middle of the pack.

      I hate to bring age into this, but how can we not? I need someone to do
      some math and get me the average age for this team. While this team has
      some VERY good players, will they have anyone left come playoffs? This
      team's REAL MVP is going to be a drug called Ibuprofen and some ice. I
      just know those Monday mornings are going to HURT. I may end up regretting
      this as I play this team week 1, but I doubt it.


      P.S. I do have a best friend that is VERY into daddies - let me know if
      interested.

      This team is STACKED. They have a ton of experience with an astonishing 7
      travel players on this squad. However their QB, Kristin L. will be playing
      multiple games every single week as she is also QBing in the Women’s+
      division, as well as the Valkyries in Gay Bowl. That’s a grand total of 23
      games in a span of 10 weeks! (more if you include playoffs) Will her arm
      make it through the entire season? I know mine surely would not. Does
      captain Michael B. have a back up plan that doesn’t include yelling at the
      refs?

      QB Andre B. is coming off a season where they pulled off arguably one of
      the greatest playoff upsets in DCGFFL history, knocking off \#1 seed
      Forest in the first round. With 2 established vets Paul W. and John C., as
      well as a new projected star rookie Chad H. backing him up, this team
      could get hot and make some noise this season. Although their season is
      unpredictable, we DO know we will be seeing besties Carnell B. & Alex H.
      every weekend at Bunker (followed byTaco Bell) post Sunday funday.

      This team shows some promise - they have 2 of the fastest players in the
      league with Nick and Art, strong leadership with vets Andy P. and Matt
      H.-- but they seem to lack a true 4th receiver. Will the newest twink in
      the league, Chris Riotta-Rogers, step his game up and show us something
      we’ve never seen before? Will Alex D. and Vinny show up with no hangover?
      Probably not. I have a feeling we will be seeing this team at 8am come
      playoffs.

      This team has two very experienced leaders with Andrew A. at QB and Trey
      P. as captain. While this roster has some talent, I do not see this team
      winning many games and I expect this squad to struggle early with 3 very
      tough games to start their season. I do think this team can definitely
      bounce back with a good pick in the supplemental draft and make some noise
      in the latter half of the season. Keep your heads up until then!!

      Rookie QB in Matt R. and long time Captain and DJ lead the way for Kelly
      Green this season. This squad features some solid and sure handed
      receivers with Kevin H., Luke R., milk-man Luke B. and veteran Brendan M..
      They also have a very good rushing core with DJ and Noah M. If they can
      hold down the fort on defense while Matt continues to improve at QB every
      week, this team has a chance to surprise us, or not.

      Rookie Chris D. believes he is ready to be our newest star DCGFFL QB. He
      has the confidence, the swag, a new football and a new pair of cleats.
      Chris and Brandon M were even able to draft the best dual threat
      cone/blocker in the league with TJ C., the man with the greatest hair in
      the league with Michael A., and long time bestie Everett.


      …It’s going to be an 8 seed for me and an 8 A.M. play-in game in the
      playoffs.
