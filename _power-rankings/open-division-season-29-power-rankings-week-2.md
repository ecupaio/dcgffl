  Pete D. and Jay I. 2 weeks in, and the League rankings are giving instability,
  chaos, and drama — we’re serving 3 body problem realness, honey!  Some 8 teams
  walked off the fields with a different result from last week, leaving 4 teams
  at 2-0 and 4 teams at 0-2.  I guess that makes it an ordered chaos? I don’t
  know, there’s probably someone in this league who’s a closet physicist, but
  it’s not us.  Truth be told, we’re just glad to see some versatility so far
  this season, which truly is the spice of life.   On an entirely different note
  from that, last week’s author has challenged us PR drafters to bring our best
  journalistic game without robot-assisted writeups.  I guess he was trying to
  set the example by using his own team’s writeup to whinge about … checks notes
  … the hardworking photographers of this league not taking enough pictures of
  him?  If the goal was to prove that his writeups were his own, then goal
  achieved: that one is absolutely the product of an all-too-human psyche. Of
  course, we join in and affirm his pledge though – everything that you’ll read
  next is the product of our own zany minds.  You’re welcome.  OK, now that the
  pens are sharpened, let’s dig into just who the tops, bottoms, vers kings and
  chaotic queens of the week are!

      Another robust and girthy performance from this team. Though they had the
      upside of playing a Gold team missing their QB, they still racked up the
      score with some 5 TD’s. Those of us one field over even got an eyeful of
      one Highlight Reel moment: Andrew G. shaking and baking his way into the
      endzone. We’re sending our well wishes to their felled Captain to be
      equally speedy in his recovery. Also, we’ve got a breakout rookie star in
      Gerel H, who’s joining us after playing in one other gay sports league
      (volleyball) --- and kickball too. If there are any signs of impotence or
      performance anxiety in this team, we haven’t seen them yet.

      The frog poses must be paying off, because these bottoms are looking
      powerful! As QB Cam astutely put it, this team’s path to success goes
      through drafting a bunch of bearded, backwards hat-wearing bros…
      basically, 4 Drew C.’s. The rookie still known to us only as The Hoyler
      Brother continues to be everywhere on the field, and together this team
      easily dispatched with Team Black. Tapping into a different form of
      strength from the Royal Hungness, the Froggy Bottoms are shaking and
      baking in their own way, and the result is some delicious cake. Grab a
      spoon, cause we feel like there’s a lot more to come!

      Nothing beats a JetBlue Holiday… including \*\* \*\* Juan Burgundy. Once
      again, Lynch piloted the team to victory, fresh off a full game in the
      women’s+ league just minutes earlier (does she ever get tired?). Cedric R.
      made his season debut and immediately proved to be vers-atile, snatching
      an interception and dropping multiple touchdowns flawlessly. And let’s
      talk about Ken G., who showed he’s more than just eye candy by securing
      his first touchdown of the season. With this mix of hustle, heart, and
      just the right amount of drama, this crew looks fully cleared for takeoff.

      All hail Captain (ok, QB) Kirk! Winning a game without one’s primary QB is
      always an impressive feat, and this team (narrowly) pulled it off. The
      Chad M.-Quinn receiver combo is continuing to deliver results for this
      team, and Kirk was smart to rely on them to make him look good. Yes
      Sapphire gave y’all a run for your money, but you found a way to win and
      we pinky swear that’s important.


      OK look, your team name is really, really awful. What are you pinky
      swearing to? With whom are you swearing it? Is there some pinky-kink
      community that the rest of us don’t know about? Are you keeping the
      meaning of this name like a secret, or keeping it like an oath? We’re
      clearly perturbed and disturbed by this, but long as you keep the Ws
      coming, it probably won’t matter.

      Yes it’s no surprise that this team, with the return of QB Oriya, beat
      Iron Gray. But it’s *how* they did it, plumping and dumping all over this
      field. With a stat sheet so long it would make some of us blush, Oriya
      spread the ball around extremely effectively while giving a signature
      pick-6, Louie netted 3 sacks, and rookie Clay had a breakout performance
      on both sides of the ball (welcome to the stage after your redshirting!).
      This team is a threat y’all, and we better watch out: maybe they just
      mercy ruled the other team so they could notch their tally mark and move
      on to the next one quicker.

      You’ve gotta hand it to them: this team solved last week’s problem of
      losing by not scoring in the second half by … winning by not scoring in
      the second half. New Foam, same as the Old Foam? Well, fortunately for
      them, just about everything else was different from the prior week. They
      came out looking far more confident, poised, and coordinated and stunned
      us Petty Officers with enough shots across the bow to take a 2-score lead
      that they held onto for much of the game. Veteran QB Austin P.’s increased
      utilization of Jamal L. looked a big part in that turn of fortunes. Though
      they almost managed to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory by that
      nailbiter end of the game, they showed that at least this time, Defense
      really does win games. And that, by Week 2, there already may be a New
      Foam in town.

      Well, we brought the gametime drama to y’all, if not the petty. My fellow
      officers and gentlemen came into this game buoyed by last week’s upset
      win. But down some of our bunkermates, we just couldn’t get our sea legs
      in the first half, especially on the attacking side of the ball, leaving
      us down 2 scores by the end of it. Nevertheless, we looked back in our
      habit by Act II and had the wind in our sails: QB Andre B. fired some
      great torpedoes to his group of veteran receivers -–notably including
      rookie-veteran receiver Chad H.---, got a pick of his own, and we were
      looking in ship-shape to eke out a W, getting to the red zone with seconds
      left on the clock. Alas, these seamen just couldn’t finish – but watch out
      y’all, we’re simply frothing at the mouth for more. Oh-ficially.

      Oh, and my biggest regret in my team’s loss is that League Mom Margie H.
      had to see it in her new role as Shadow Ref (and looking stunning in the
      zebra print!). I have dishonored you, Mother, and I will now be committing
      seppuku.

      In this week’s Team Black vs. Team Green showdown, the Hightower banner
      came out on top. SuperGing Josh netted a couple TD’s for this team, and
      Austin A. brought the pressure on D. Despite that, and despite this team’s
      cloying “Let’s Go Baddies” chants on the sidelines, their troops were
      largely in disarray. Also, we hear Team Black has lost even more of its
      dragons (or maybe they’re the dragon riders, idk) to injury. Again sending
      well wishes for their recovery, and maybe some new eggs will hatch for you
      in the Supplemental draft!

      Backup QB Nick W. stepped up and into the pocket for this team admirably,
      especially given they were against the dominant force of the Royal
      Hungness. And we’re told that Mike H. proved that daddies can still be a
      threat on those fields (ahem ahem, Iron Gray)! They couldn’t spin straw
      into gold this time, but given the givens, winning this game would’ve
      truly been the stuff of fairy tales. With this team’s continued
      overperformance at Sunday Funday, win or lose, we’d say they didn’t seem
      too pressed about it either. Oh, and you won’t find last week’s PR author
      represented in the Week 2 Flickr album, and by no fault of our unpaid
      League photographers. Maybe he was off recruiting some NYC paps in hopes
      their cameras will follow him down to Carter Barron?


      On a final note, this author had to google the team name to attempt to
      make sense of it and the results… left me every bit as mystified as when I
      started.

      The Jacks of(f) All Trade lived up to their name this week, pulling out a
      gritty 32-25 win under the steady command of Captain Phillips. Forget Tom
      Hanks… this Captain is the one calling the shots now, and the ship belongs
      to him… at least for this week. QB Aldrian did get a “little” testy and
      yelled at some of his receivers. Although he did provide them with a
      half-hearted apology on the sidelines and used being “locked-in” as his
      excuse. However, a few of his throws were intercepted… so perhaps he has a
      different definition of “locked-in” than the rest of us.

      It’s spooky season and the Jock-O’ Lanterns proved to be frightening on
      the field this week. This crew proved they don’t have Halloween magic…
      they have Andy A. He was everywhere, snagging touchdowns, tossing
      conversions, and generally making life miserable for the Collared Queens’
      defenders. QB Hunt spread the ball around, racking up touchdown throws
      even while taking a couple of sacks, to add a little pumpkin spice to
      their game. Will the Jock-O’ Lanterns be terrifying or terrified next
      week… we shall see.

      The Collared Queens were no match for the Jock-O’ Lanterns pumpkin spice
      taking their win streak from 1 to 0. This week, Kevin H showed that he
      likes it both ways by doing well on offense AND defense. Unfortunately,
      this wasn’t enough to secure the win and these queens did not come home
      with the crown. The committee would also like to humbly request this team
      follow in the footsteps of the distinguished collared Queen Elizabeth and
      get a full set of Elizabethan wigs for wig day.

      Under the D… more like under the influence. This team was clearly too
      hungover from the night before at Shakers. However, they tried to continue
      last night’s party on the field with their giant speaker. It might be time
      for a new playlist on that speaker and maybe that’s just what that team
      needs to break their losing streak. DCGFFL NEWS caught up with Captain
      Morgan (ba dum tsss) before the game and he expressed full confidence in
      their ability to pillage, plunder, and take the win. After the game, he
      could not be reached for comment.

      “Juan” day this team may actually bring home a win… but only if the rest
      of the roster remembers they’re allowed to play too. With Juan doing ALL
      of the scoring, this matchup looked less like football and more like a
      one-man show titled “Juan vs. Light Blue.” Ron Burgundy said it best:
      “Stay classy,” but for this crew, it’s more like “stay watching Juan do
      everything.”

      We’ll use this opportunity to once again distinguish ourselves from last
      week’s review, which was so nasty and rude to this team. Sure, as of this
      writing, the gems are looking a little rough and uncut (not that there’s
      anything wrong with that!), and losing to a team missing its QB isn’t the
      most encouraging outcome. But *we* think with some polish, you’re bound to
      win a game or two! Shade aside, Sir Michael of the Flowing Locks is
      continuing to eat on both sides of the ball (we note TJ having been
      heavily guarded by Pink), and you’re starting to tap into some solid
      rookie talent too. This game was a very, very close one, and we’re seeing
      signs of life stirring in this Coochie yet.

      We get it, as with RuPaul herself, the old jokes about this team basically
      write themselves. Hell, they wrote one themselves. So we won’t do that –
      that would just be tired and worn-down from overuse. Plus, they could use
      some mercy after that game, which by all accounts, was a bit of a nail in
      the coffin — so we’ll spare you the play by play. Instead, we’ll speak to
      all the wonderful things your favorite daddy can be: reliable, sturdy,
      supportive, and most importantly, generou$$. Give us more of that,
      pleeease daddies? PS - We’re told one of their only bits of joy and
      youthful energy here came from . . . the players’ children on the
      sidelines, which honestly tracks.
