  Derrick H. We’re a third of the way through the regular season and we’re
  finally getting deep enough to see some trends—both exciting and alarming.
  This weekend is All Things Go: the DMV’s exceptionally gay music festival
  where you spend the day ping-ponging between alternating acts on two stages
  and praying it isn’t muddy like it seems to be most weekends at Carter Barron.
  Following this weekend’s football games, a quick shower, and a stop at Shakers
  to pregame/Sunday Funday, that’s where I’ll be headed. A restful Sunday before
  the work week or something like that...  Anyway, since music festivals are on
  my mind, that’s how this week’s power rankings are going to be structured. The
  top teams? Headliners. The next group are the subheadliners, followed by the
  undercard. Don’t like your team’s spot on the poster? Well, keep in mind that
  Chappell Roan was buried on the Coachella lineup a couple years ago and
  quickly rose to superstardom, playing to the largest crowd at Lollapolooza
  just two months later and headlining just about every festival she has stepped
  foot in since then!

      Here’s your DCGFFLpalooza poster:


      ![](/img/image1.png){: width="1016" height="1017"}


      This Light Blue team has it all! A solid roster from top to bottom. The
      resume to show for it. A TikTok hit that supports their billing as our
      headliner. They handled Royal Blue with ease, allowing just one score all
      afternoon. They’re at the top of this poster, but do they have the stamina
      to keep it up through the fall?

      What’s the opposite of “always the bridesmaid, never the bride?” This
      team. For the second week in a row, they’ve pulled out a win by a single
      point, having the ball bumped into their defender’s hands by Navy. We’ll
      see if they can become an album team next week, but in the meantime, their
      singles are enough to catapult them up this lineup.

      In his absence, a pregame JC A. speech apparently lit the wrong fire under
      this team. They were easily handled by Light Blue and managed to receive a
      flag for complaining too much. Their prior performances have them in a
      solid billing, but they’re at a real risk to go from mainstays to
      one-hit-wonders. They’re probably not gonna be happy about this either.
  - team: _teams/s29-forest-green.md
    record: 2-1
    text: >-
      With music festivals, it always comes down to networking and who you know.
      Why do I have forest green ranked above the other 2-1 teams? I’m their
      management, and I did a bang-up job in those negotiations. I hear you, I
      hear you! “They didn’t score last week!” “They’re ranked above the team
      that beat them!” Like other teams here, the lineup was slim due to folks
      traveling for other sports (or in my case, out due to inexplicably
      spraining his foot at Epcot without even drinking around the world!) But,
      this team has shown that they have a catalogue of hits so far this season,
      and the promoters took that into account despite their last single not
      being a smash hit.
  - team: _teams/s29-gold.md
    record: 2-1

      Nick W. stepped up at QB and the result was another win. The ball was
      spread on offense and four different players recorded a touchdown. Nick’s
      play is something to watch. He’s part of this group on the lineup this
      year, but will his management encourage him to go solo (QB full-time) next
      season? Only time will tell, but for now, this team is going up, up, up…
  - team: _teams/s29-kelly-green.md
    record: 2-1
    text: >-
      Kelly followed the playbook needed to beat Black to a tee: outlast them
      long enough and the injuries will handle them for you. That said, despite
      trailing for most of the afternoon, their comeback was impressive, and
      they shot up the rankings due to their single-point victory via a
      last-minute touchdown by Luke B.
  - team: _teams/s29-white.md
    record: 2-1

      If I had to pick a band to compare this team to it would be Maroon 5.
      They’re not bad, they have the hits, and most music festivals would love
      to have them at the right price. On the flipside, I have not once heard
      someone say that Maroon 5 is their favorite band. But you cannot deny the
      talent!
  - team: _teams/s29-purple.md
    record: 2-1
    text: >-
      Purple had just 7 players and were missing both their captain and starting
      QB, but that didn’t stop them from running circles around Sapphire.
      Putting up 42 points and allowing zero is impressive. The lack of letting
      up is admirable. Sapphire didn’t even cross the 40 yard line for most of
      the game. We’re excited to see how they fare with a more robust roster,
      but they have managed to hold a respectable billing thus far and round out
      the upper half of our rankings.
  - team: _teams/s29-coral.md
    record: 1-2
    text: >-
      And so begins the end of our undercard. Coral nearly moved up to the next
      line on our poster with a 31-13 victory over Seafoam, and will be a team
      to watch moving forward. They are putting together a solid resume, and the
      booking agents took that into account. Hopefully they’re working on that
      next big album with a killer single to launch them into headlining
      contention.
  - team: _teams/s29-deep-orange.md
    record: 1-2

      Orange sports a losing record after three weeks, but is still in a
      respectable place. There’s still a lot of season left, and with Ben H. at
      QB, things could turn around in a hurry. In the meantime, we will see you
      on stage at this festival at 4 p.m. when the sun is blaring directly into
      your eyes much like it does for a lot of receivers every Sunday..
  - team: _teams/s29-navy-heather.md
    record: 1-2

      So what happens when you blow an 18-point lead? You stay after the game
      for your an extra rehearsal (practice) that you swear you were going to do
      regardless of the outcome. They swear this was always the plan, but I’m
      just the messenger. It’s not any consolation, but the loss did come
      against Pink, who is near the top of the poster.
  - team: _teams/s29-cardinal.md
    record: 1-2
    text: >-
      Cardinal brought the offense, putting up 54 points—the highest of any team
      this week! This team left the defense at home, however, giving up 40
      points. I guess it doesn’t matter if you end up scoring more, but this
      would stress me out. Their billing on the poster is respectable, and they
      would certainly have some diehards who would excuse a less than perfect
      performance.
  - team: _teams/s29-black.md
    record: 1-2
    text: >-
      Everyone is hurt and their set is sponsored by Icy Hot and Advil. Six
      injured players on this roster? Leading the majority of the game but
      falling behind due to twisted ankles and a depleted receiver corps? The
      good news is it’s early in the season. The bad news is it’s early in the
      season. Time for this team to take a break from banging themselves up --
      take the stage and bang a drum instead.
  - team: _teams/s29-seafoam.md
    record: 1-2
    text: >-
      They managed to chart a little bit last week, but the follow-up left a bit
      to be desired. The offense again has some questions, but I see the vision.
      We’re rooting for them to deliver a memorable performance and bounce back
      up the charts, but right now it’s giving your college buddy sharing his
      SoundCloud page hoping someone, *ANYONE* will listen.
  - team: _teams/s29-iron-gray.md
    record: 0-3
    text: >-
      Every well-to-do music festival needs those legacy acts that are put on
      stage early in the day to get folks in the gates at a reasonable hour, and
      that’s what Iron Gray is. They have a lot of pieces that have impressed in
      the past, and as they play together more are having some positives to
      build on. Someone (not me) did the math, and this team has the highest
      average age of any team this season at 38, just below the 40 points they
      managed to score versus Cardinal last weekend.

      I’m going to give it to you straight: Sapphire is only performing at this
      music festival because they’re a nepo baby. Last week’s 42-0 walloping has
      them rounding out our poster. Hopefully they sing better than they play
      football!
