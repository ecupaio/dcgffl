  James C. It’s a month into Season 29 and let’s talk about the big “What If”
  given the many missed opportunities on the fields this week. That missed pull
  that could have stopped the touchdown run, that missed-by-an-inch reach that
  could have been a sack, that picture-perfect one-hand catch if only it were
  actually caught, that tipped ball that bounced from the receiver’s hand and
  became an INT…in an alternate universe, a parallel world, a different
  timeline…whatever you call it, these would have been great plays that could
  have led to a different dynamic, and even a different outcome. This week, we
  celebrate some of these unfortunate moments and wish the players responsible
  better luck next game. More importantly, let’s send our best regards to all
  the travel players and wish them best of luck this weekend at Gay Bowl San
  Diego!

      The DCGFFLpalooza headliner from last week remains at the top! They’re
      probably already in their preferred timeline as Kristin & Co took care of
      business and got a dominant win over the only other undefeated team. Since
      they are already blessed and highly favored, maybe they can ask on behalf
      of everybody that suffered in the heat last Sunday if there is a universe
      where the weather could have been kinder for games happening in late
      September?


      Good luck to Mike B., Jordan A., Brandon K., Cedric R., and Ryan W. of
      Light Blue this weekend at Gay Bowl!

      This team’s ranking is going UP with another win this week! This team put
      up a big lead early and held onto it until the end, thanks to the solid
      showing on both sides of the ball. Luis C. escaped the defenders –
      seemingly unstoppable. A couple of picks kept Navy Heather scoreless in
      the first half. They might wish their own second-half picks didn’t happen,
      but heading into the BYE week with 3-1 must be satisfying.


      Good luck to Daniel H., Luis C., Oriya C., Gabe A., and Patrick S. this
      weekend at Gay Bowl!

      They are climbing up the rankings with another solid game, despite a close
      finish. Their fighting spirit was best seen as Kevin H. was seemingly
      swamped by defenders, but somehow escaped the crowd with his flag intact
      and ran for a long TD. QB Matt R. not only took care of business but had
      his team’s professional development in mind, overruling their captain and
      the entire sideline to not kneel it out at the end, so the team “could get
      more reps.” Let’s not ask “what if” in this scenario…


      Good luck to Luke B., Derrick J., Matt R., Kevin H., and Noah M. this
      weekend at Gay Bowl!

      Without their QB Wyatt, Captain Zo, and a few other key contributors, this
      team couldn’t get the win to remain undefeated. A gnarly pinky injury
      suffered by Blake B. made their team name sound more like a curse. Maybe
      in an alternate timeline everyone’s vacations were better stacked and
      they’d still be undefeated. The world may never know.


      Good luck to Alonzo M. and Quinn M. this weekend at Gay Bowl!

      Before the game, word on the street said that this team was stronger than
      their record made it seem. After opening the game with an 18-0 lead (in
      part by snagging two early INTs), their opponent’s sideline could be heard
      joking about the mercy rule. They played tough and drew some penalties,
      but their key contributors like Brandon R.’s and Andy A.’s many big plays
      eventually sealed the win. If they could change one thing in this
      timeline, QB Ben H. might wish that first-half safety never happened, as
      it led to Gold nearly tying it up by halftime, before Orange pulled away
      in the second.


      Good luck to Marvin W., Andy A., Brandon R., AC C., and Ricky H. this
      weekend at Gay Bowl!

      For the second week in a row, this team was the highest scoring one in the
      league with 42 points! Also for the second week in a row, they may have
      left their defense at home, as their opponent was the second-highest
      scoring team with 41 points. But, a win is a win, and a high-scoring game
      is also a win for the early-morning spectators. Give the girls a show!


      Good luck to Charles D., Shaq B., Aaron B., Juan V., AJ R., Fernando H.,
      and Jared M. this weekend at Gay Bowl!

      They got the win – and highlight reels for several of their key
      contributors. Their supplemental pick Mya made several crucial catches,
      including the final interception to clinch the win. Their interim captain,
      Jordan M., could be seen making plays all over the field. Charlie H. got a
      great contested TD. Aaron B. declared his team needed to schedule a
      practice to learn how to catch the ball. So what’s the “what if” moment
      for this team you might ask? Maybe Aaron B. would hope that he did not
      drop what could have been an easy interception near the end of the game
      and seal the close game sooner.


      Good luck to Morgan W., Jordan M., Aaron B., and Brian W. this weekend at
      Gay Bowl!

      Without their QB this week, this team seemed a bit lost in the first half.
      Shane L. and Cam B. both stepped up as QBs, but both also ended their
      first drives with an interception. There was also an unfortunate play
      where 4 of their defenders just couldn't pull the flag and had to watch a
      Sapphire player run all the way into the end zone. They played their
      hearts out though, especially in the second half, making more catches,
      covering the field…Chris D. had a few carries, most memorably running into
      TJ C. and getting manhandled in broad daylight. Their rushers like Joe Z.
      made a great effort, leaving beautiful moments like in the photo above. In
      a perfect world, that would have been a sack. Well, better luck next time!


      Good luck to Cam B., Trey P., Andrew A., and Bryan B. this weekend at Gay
      Bowl!

      It was a tough loss, but this team made sure the Game of the Week lived up
      to the hype (at least for the first half…). QB Andy P. was back after
      missing two weeks – after a bumpy start going down 0-18 and with all hope
      seeming lost, Gold got it together with a scoring drive followed by a rare
      safety, recorded by Chris R.R. Chris was heard asking his teammates the
      important questions at halftime. Notably: “What’s a safety?” and “Wait, I
      scored two points?” The second half might have been equally as confusing
      for them, as this team was not able to keep up with its opponent. In
      another universe this team made the comeback, but unfortunately, it’s a
      loss in this one.


      Good luck to Alex D., Matt H., Art H., Nick W., and Vinny V. this weekend
      at Gay Bowl!

      Missing three key receivers, this team fell short (probably the first time
      Cam has been called short) again, this time with a single-point loss.
      Multiple players contributed to their scoring plays, including
      supplemental pick Carlos F., making them the second-highest scoring team
      this week. They made two 2-point conversions after their final two TDs of
      the game…if only they had made one more conversion earlier in the game. As
      every QB always says: “extra point plays matter!”


      Good luck to Andrew H., Cam M., Aaron R., Derrick H., and Victor J. this
      weekend at Gay Bowl!

      Despite the weather being hot and unfriendly during their game, this team
      mounted a comeback – down 13-25 against Royal Heather (which this week
      only had 7-person squad…but going up against JC at the opposing QB, a win
      is a win). It was a team effort from key contributors like Jamal L.,
      Austin P., and Brandon T. on both sides of the ball. Captain Logan
      manhandled JC and Zak S. made an impressive catch on a deep ball to seal
      the win with an XP.


      Good luck to Justin P., Brandon T., Logan D., Austin P., Jamal L., and
      Thomas L. this weekend at Gay Bowl!

      Playing with 7 players, this team started strong with JC A. back at QB and
      went up two scores. But after a combo of the midday heat, them running out
      of gas, and their opponent coming back with a full team effort, the game
      ended as a one-point heartbreaker. If there were an alternate universe,
      the weather is just a little bit cooler so JC can maintain his perfect win
      record when leading by two scores. Instead, in this one he got a pretty
      rough reality check.


      Good luck to Dawson C., JC A., and Jordan F. this weekend at Gay Bowl!

      Which felt harder to swallow…missing half of their roster due to boo boos,
      or having an unfortunate tipoff turned interception 10-yards from the goal
      line with only 30 seconds left, when they almost had the game in the bag?


      Still, even without their QB, this team managed to keep the game within
      one point. Nick J., and Kenny J., showed out and Josh E. played a stellar
      game at QB. Their rookie Cash ran all over the field until leaving the
      game with an injury. At this point, they might want to switch to a
      different timeline where they didn’t acquire 7 injured players on the
      roster just a month into this season…In any case, BYE week is here and
      let’s hope they get the time to recover and regroup.


      Good luck to Kenny J. and Michael Z. this weekend at Gay Bowl!

      So the extra practice after their week 3 loss, at least for a solid second
      half, helped this team to avoid mercy rule territory. Maybe they would
      prefer playing with an 18-point lead before collapsing like they did last
      week rather than playing catch-up? Nevertheless, Clem and Pete D. should
      be happy with their picks and Andre B. turned on their offense to end the
      game within two scores. Maybe after ONE MORE practice they’ll clinch that
      W!


      Good luck to Paul W., John C., Bradley M., and Carnell B. on this weekend
      at Gay Bowl!

      The nepo baby from last week’s lineup flexed those family connections to
      come out on top this time! QB Chris D.’s adaptability gave White’s
      defenders a hard time, and this team generally had better luck pulling the
      flags and making important stops. TJ C. and Brandon M. were just as easily
      seen on the field with plays on both sides, as they were heard – as they
      had fun live commenting after every play. Andre C. also had a great day
      escaping the defenders and getting touchdowns…though, in a different
      timeline, his beautiful, single-handed non-catch would actually be
      beautiful, single-handedly caught.


      Good luck to Chris D., Everett W., TJ C., and TJ B. this weekend at Gay
      Bowl!

      While they’re still winless after this week, Gay Gray RP put up a very
      tough fight against Kelly Green. This team made some great plays, with big
      interceptions from Zach and Mariam M. You could tell it was a close game
      when a quarrel broke out between Zach and opponent Luke B. on Kelly –
      disputing an alleged flag guard. In another timeline, it might have been a
      penalty, but in this one: Zach got the TD, Luke and Kelly Green got the W,
      and the sidelines got a show.


      Good luck to Jorge M., Zach M., and Twon H. this weekend at Gay Bowl!
