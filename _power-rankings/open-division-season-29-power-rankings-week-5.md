  Zak S.  After I burned all of my PTO and had to withdraw from Gay Bowl (and a
  picturesque vacation in San Diego), I was one of the few who didn’t limp their
  way to a cloudy Carter Barron. Shoutout Meteorologist Logan D. for an accurate
  weather forecast despite most league members praying for a rain out! 
season: 29
week: 5
rankings:

      In stepping up as Light Blue's backup QB, Charlie had some big shoes to
      fill. Too bad they were not as big as Cam’s. Light Blue suffers its first
      loss but stays at the top.

      Who needs your original QB anyway? Not this team. With Oriya and Honeycutt
      out for this game, Luis had to step up at QB – and step up he did. In his
      first Sunday start at QB, he led his team to a third consecutive win. Can
      Luis take them to the number one spot next week? If this team runs down
      the field as fast as Luis does out of the pocket, they just might!

      Matt R., Derrick J., et al. win in a shootout with Gold. Luke B. was left
      WIDE open multiple times and caught several TD’s to keep them in
      contention. But the biggest moment of the game came when Kevin H. came up
      with a huge Hail Mary catch, putting his team in the lead seconds before
      time expired. A perfect pitch and catch, giving Kelly yet another comeback
      victory.

      40 points seems to be the magic number for San Diego's \#1 newscaster Juan
      Burgundy. 4th place seems fitting for a captain who catches 4 TD’s but
      lets just as many through on defense. The Cardinal rule of football: Score
      SO many times that you don’t NEED a defense.

      Another team whose defense was nowhere to be found, as has often been the
      case for this team. Pink suffered a shootout loss to Coral. Quinn was
      catching passes left and right, but it wasn't enough. Zo was deeeep in the
      trash talk but quickly silenced as yet another TD was piled on. Maybe less
      time heckling and more time calling defense next time?

      White pulled out the win with strong performances by Bryan and Trey. Chris
      and Keyur were virtually uncovered, catching every pass. A solid team win,
      if not particularly flashy or exciting. Kind of like white paint.

      Coming up on the right side of the shootout, Aaron, Jordan and company
      survived a Pink Out. They could have run out the clock, but decided to run
      it up late. I would've too, if another team tried to punk me.
  - team: _teams/s29-seafoam.md
    record: 3-2

      Down early with several players sore from Gay Bowl San Diego – including
      QB Austin, whose injuries limited his mobility – Seafoam was on the ropes
      against Iron Grey going into half. But Jamal was all over the place on
      both sides of the ball, catching TDs and getting picks. You can’t double
      both Jamal and Zak, so pick your poison – and Iron Grey chose poorly. When
      this team puts together two halves, not many will stop them.

      Cam was slinging it around the yard, but he had the unfortunate luck of
      having his receivers bring back a case of the drops from San Diego.
      Despite the butterfingers, they were able to snag a 1 TD win over
      previously undefeated Light Blue.

      BREAKING NEWS: Sources confirm that JC Adams announced he will officially
      hang up his cleats if he suffers another loss. We bring you this message
      for accountability purposes with no ulterior motive at all.

      On paper this team should be in the top five. But that’s not how it always
      shakes out at Carter Barron. Can someone explain what is going on with
      this squad?? Because I can’t.

      The pass defense for the Demon Twink Hunters must have missed their flight
      back to DC, because they were nowhere to be found. Tbh, I probably
      would've just stayed at the beach too. After nearly sealing a narrow
      victory, Gold gave up a hail mary TD with 0:12 seconds left to lose the
      game. Demoralizing. Disappointing. Avoidable. I could go on. On a positive
      note, Andy really *spread* the ball around on O, having 4 different
      players catch TD’s.

      The triumphant return of (definitely still injured) Tiger and Austin gave
      Baddy issues some early mojo on defense. Going into half they thought they
      were going to hand White an upset. But a good old DC reality check kicked
      in and their luck, and ability to catch the ball, ran out. If only they
      could just stay healthy, they might stack some W’s. But that’s a big, BIG
      IF this late in the season.

      This team continues to improve with Chris calling the shots at QB.
      Shoutout to TJ who snagged a couple of TD’s in front of the fam. Always a
      great feeling. Happy times are ahead for this squad. They really could use
      it.

      Jim C. had the troops going early, capitalizing on two early turnovers
      from Seafoam, but Grey’s outdated tactics fell apart as the day went on.
      This team is DESPERATE for a win and you can feel it. Or literally every
      team member will tell you at Funday. Because two halves make a whole, and
      any whole is a goal.
