  Tiger. The nice weather must have put everyone in a good mood because, man,
  y’all were drama-free this weekend! Where’s the on-field blow ups? Where’s
  everyone on Delta Force reminding all the players on the Commanders how they
  beat them after every play? Where will a silicone breast fall during the
  Midseason drag show this weekend?  We, the power-ranking committee, may be
  disappointed in the distinct lack of pot stirring we can do as a result but
  we’re coming down to the last few weeks where you’ll have a chance to redeem
  yourselves.  “Make it work” – Tim Gunn.  Question of the week: Since,
  apparently, everyone is feeling so nice…Who is your pick for most underrated
  player in the league? 
season: 29
week: 6

  - team: _teams/s29-purple.md

      These plumps dumped all over Gold despite only having 6 players for most
      of the game. Luis yet again had a star turn at QB while Oriya was out and
      Honeycutt was at the field (but apparently only after the game was already
      over?). Luis’ odds of getting called up to full-time QB next season
      against his will have risen dramatically. His odds of still being friends
      with Oriya afterward are falling rapidly.


      It’s giving…inevitability.

      The plan - hike the ball, give it to Jordan A., have three large men push
      the defense out of the way, let Jordan move forward a few yards, repeat
      until you run out the clock. The execution - flawless. The result -
      victory. The excitement - lacking.


      It’s giving…florals for spring. Groundbreaking.

      Well we can all thank Gerel for JC’s decision NOT to retire from football
      in his advanced age after almost single-handedly delivering his team the
      win with multiple TDs and INTs. JC, in typical fashion, showed up at 8:59
      AM for a 9:00 AM game – so nothing has changed in the many, MANY years
      he’s been in this league.


      The less athletic, less attractive, less charismatic, less aged, and
      decidedly less broken Ricchetti brother was seen stepping up as interim
      captain by the end of the game to fill in for his injured captain and
      absentee QB. Now THAT’S leadership.


      It’s giving…nepotism.

      These froggies hippity-hopped their way to the goal line so many times
      they didn’t even realize they were three scores ahead by the end. Desiree
      decided to stunt on all the boys and girls in open division Sunday (after
      already putting up 3 TDs and 2 picks in W+) with many, MANY important
      plays and pulls. Meanwhile, Brian H., *infamous* for his well-known
      inflated ego and *incredibly* boastful nature, secured yet another MVP
      this week.


      Unlike frogs though, this team has slippery fingers so they probably could
      have won by even more if they didn’t drop the ball so often! They aren’t a
      prince yet, but are just a smooch away!


      It’s giving…pucker up.

      Pinky Swear decided to match Black’s hemorrhaging of players by having
      practically every single player on their team show up on Sunday. As they
      stressed about getting everyone playing time, Wyatt was able to string
      together several plays to a reliable, rotating core of receivers to keep
      momentum up for his team. He may have gotten grabbed (\*probably\* on
      accident) almost every play by Black’s 3 rushers along the way but he was
      able to connect with a combination of Ivan, Zo, Quinn, or Chad to seal
      another win. Pressure’s on now to go for a back to back championship
      winning streak!


      It’s giving…first time at the gay bar.

      It’s groundhog’s day for Maroon with yet another win after stacking up 40
      points. Captain Juan was kind enough to share the spotlight this week,
      allowing Shaq and Charles to also get some stats on the board. A proud
      example to the community that sharing IS caring.


      It’s giving…up going for offensive MVP this season.

      Kelly went into their game on Sunday a little distracted and probably a
      bit hot and bothered after Captain DJ’s warm up tunes were consistently
      interrupted by notification alerts from THAT app. You know the one. The
      one you don’t tell your parents about. The one you always talk about
      deleting but then never do. The one that if it ever got hacked and
      everyone saw everything you’d said you’d do to him, you might need to move
      to a new city and join another gay football league with a new name. But
      no. Not AGAIN.


      And that’s why Kelly was so distracted and lost.


      It’s giving…headless torso pic.

      This was not the same team I played against last week. Missed pulls,
      dropped balls, cats and dogs living together. Mass hysteria. According to
      onlookers, they have continued to live up to their modest reputation
      as…well…plain. But it’s ok, just like everyone’s favorite ice cream flavor
      (vanilla) you’re definitely everyone’s favorite team to win it all this
      season.


      Also, as a service to this community, I’ll ask the question: can y’all
      clarify who’s trade? Inquiring minds want to know.


      It’s giving…master of none.

      These jocks came out to share in the festive Halloween spirit and give
      Seafoam a second-half of the game jump scare! Finally this team is doing
      everything you’d expect them to: Recto catching some deep balls and eyes
      on the sideline, Marvin pushing aside anyone who gets in his way, Ben
      commenting on every call by the refs, Liam bull rushing his way over the
      defenders, Jens having a drink and a chuckle, and Andy quietly reminding
      folks that you should always cover him with 3 seconds left in the game.


      It’s giving…charisma, nerve, and talent. Still waiting on the uniqueness
      part.

      To hear Seafoam tell it – they faced gale force winds, Jock O’Lanterns the
      size of mountains, blinding sun during a 12:30 game, and referees still
      learning how to whistle (a talent I struggle with as well). A tale for the
      ages, just not one with a happy ending. While we have all decided that
      Austin P. is the undisputed nicest member of this league (if you disagree,
      you’re not being very nice), unfortunately, nice guys finish last.


      It’s giving…embellishment.

      With Captain Morgan out getting fitted for a peg-leg and hook after an
      unfortunate ankle injury at the basketball 3v3 tournament (feel better and
      also a free idea for midseason party - team social chair take note!),
      these scallywags got keelhauled by the intrepid anchormen. They may have
      been marooned this time, but once they flag down the next passing ship
      they’re out for sweet, sweet revenge next weekend. Or a quick trip to the
      \*sand\* bar afterward. (\*Booing intensifies\*)

      Those demon twinks really were out hunting for a top on Sunday morning,
      because they got dumped on, in, and all over despite having the numbers
      advantage on their opponents. At least make them buy you dinner first –
      have some dignity! But I love when sports reflect life!


      But also seriously…what happened? Are you all ok? Do I need to call a ride
      home?

      Baddy Issues? More like body issues. And I mean a LOT of them. Step aside
      body dysmorphia there’s a new girl in town and her name is polytrauma
      recidivism. Much like their famously porcelain leadership, they usually
      show signs of vitality and durability in the first half of most games
      before the cracks start showing and they shatter their bones, their hopes,
      and their dreams before the last whistle. If they can bubble wrap their
      bodies long enough, they may just make it to the playoffs with 7 players
      still intact. Two head-on collisions midgame by teammates Josh E., Luke
      K., and Austin A. don’t inspire confidence that will happen.


      It’s giving…Avian Bone Syndrome.

      Gay Gray RIP finally got their first win this week (yes the old joke is
      pretty dated \*ba dum tsss\* at this point but we’re rolling with it).
      With a touch of gray, a touch of experience, they showed those Navy seamen
      how it was done back in the good ole’ days. They don’t need any flashy
      tricks, or youthful exuberance – they make up for it with a steady hand,
      consistent pressure, and an uncanny ability to find just the right spot to
      get through the petty betties’ defenses.


      As of this week, they’re putting the R-E-S-P-E-C-T in respecting your
      elders.


      It’s giving…blowing out backs on and off the field.

      The petty officers got dishonorably discharged by those Gray Gays – with
      both Paul and Chad stepping up to fill the holes left by Andre and Clem’s
      absence at QB but nothing could quite fit just right. Like the Titanic,
      they filled up before going down.


      It’s giving…the boss’ favorite assistant.

      Speaking of pot stirring, Brandon M and the brunch babes (like seriously,
      how many have y’all had this season already? Like four?) should have stuck
      to their bottomless mimosas. Are the brunches to drown out the sadness?
      Everett W. was moving mountains to put up their only TD of the day. At
      least they’re making sure they have a FUN season!
