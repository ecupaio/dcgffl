  Tiger. The nice weather must have put everyone in a good mood because, man,
  y’all were drama-free this weekend! Where’s the on-field blow ups? Where’s
  everyone on Delta Force reminding all the players on the Commanders how they
  beat them after every play? Where will a silicone breast fall during the
  Midseason drag show this weekend?  We, the power-ranking committee, may be
  disappointed in the distinct lack of pot stirring we can do as a result but
  we’re coming down to the last few weeks where you’ll have a chance to redeem
  yourselves.  “Make it work” – Tim Gunn.  Question of the week: Since,
  apparently, everyone is feeling so nice…Who is your pick for most underrated
  player in the league? 
season: 29
week: 7

      JetBlue Holiday has been flying in first class all season. Is their
      dominance a result of great play on the field, or the fact that opposing
      QBs mysteriously go missing every time they face this squad? While we
      remain suspicious, there’s no denying the talent is there to win it all,
      but will the luck run out?

      The luck did run out for the Dumpers, whose roster held together with duct
      tape and superglue finally gave out in a flat performance against Seafoam.
      Luie has been performing solidly at QB against tough competition, but
      unless Purple can get more players on the field, they’re heading for a
      first round playoff exit.

      A superstar performance from Chad with 4 INTs induced opposing teammates
      AJ and Juan into *plenty* of swearing on Sunday. Neon Pink is quietly
      putting together their own championship resume, both on the field and on
      the drag stage. This team is going to sneak up on people in the playoffs.

      Another cardiac game for Royal, which required a game saving TD and
      conversion caught by the younger, much more athletic, more humble and far
      less broken Ricchetti brother to squeak out a one point win. Rookie Gerel
      is playing at an MVP level and several receivers are stepping up across
      the board. But the defense is leaving some question marks, which could be
      their undoing.

      Coral played an inspired game this week, taking Forest down to the wire
      and pulling out a solid win. We here at the Power Rankings always value a
      team that can finish, and they move up several spots. Even if they skipped
      playing defense this (and every other) week.

      It’s a two game skid for Kelly Green, whose hot streak is officially over.
      When this team is clicking, they’re unstoppable. When they’re not…the
      refs, their opponents, and their own teammates are going to hear about it
      - as they go through all five stages of grief in 90 minutes. Here’s hoping
      they can bounce back next week.

      With how many talented receivers there are on this team, you’d expect them
      to not croak at the end of a tight game. If they can get a few stops per
      game, they shouldn’t lose. But those have been hard to come by in recent
      weeks. We’ll see if they can keep up with Royal Heather next week.

      Will it be high tide or low tide? You never know when you play this
      Seafoam squad. But this week, it was a flood of TDs for Zak S. that made
      all the difference, even if he got a little mouthy about it. I’d like to
      see more consistency from this team before they deserve a higher ranking.

      I have to hand it to Neon Orange, who outplayed Royal for much of this
      week’s game thanks to Marvin balling out (except for an inconvenient step
      into the endzone rather than the 1 yard line as they ran down time) and
      Ben Hunt willing his team down the field. But in the end, it wasn’t enough
      to avoid a nailbiting loss. Still, this team is on the rise and could end
      the season above .500.

      Records are made to be broken, as they say. But the record set on Sunday
      by AJ who reportedly threw not one, not two, not three, but FOUR
      interceptions may be hard to top. Cardinal plunges to the bottom half of
      these rankings until they can show more versatility on offense and throw
      to more than Juan player.

      Minus QB Andrew A, this team fell victim to a lopsided loss. Other than
      that, this team is this season’s holder of the Andy Dalton line – not good
      enough to harbor championship hopes, but not bad enough to criticize.

      Look what happens when your team shows up! Gray is rolling at just the
      right time, stacking an impressive win against a talented(?) Gold team.
      Jim Connolly has found the Elixir of Life and is playing like he’s 39
      again, throwing dimes to a whole host of talented, and present receivers.
      The sky is the limit.

      That’s four losses in a row for Gold, whose 24k shine is turning into rust
      fast. After losing Nick in the second half, words used to describe Gold’s
      performance on Sunday ranged from “blowout” to “a disaster,” according to
      unnamed league sources who were not cleared to speak publicly. Unless they
      can seal the Honmoon, and quickly, the demon twinks will continue to bury
      this team.

      Go Navy, go! This group of kind souls is easy to root for, and they picked
      up their first win since week 1. Captain Pete has been insisting his team
      is better than their record suggests, and for now, he was right. Andre
      showed up for a near-perfect performance at QB, slinging the ball to Mark
      J, Paul W. and Clem for a runaway win. More good things should be on the
      horizon for this squad.

      A win is a win, right? Sapphire appears to have cast a Halloween spell on
      Black, who mysteriously lost their seventh player to a case of the
      Midseason party flu and had to forfeit. Shoutout to captain Brandon for
      getting his team into far and away the best group costume at the Midseason
      party (Serena Williams and her sisters).

      Put this team in a cryogenic restorative chamber and we’ll wake them up
      for the playoffs. It was nice of them to make sure every other team had at
      least two wins this season by forfeiting. Black, you get the sportsmanship
      award for this week &lt;3
