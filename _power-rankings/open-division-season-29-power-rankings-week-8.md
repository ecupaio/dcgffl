  Blake B. I hate gay Halloween, what do you mean you’re the DCGFFL power
  rankings? A gorgeous Sunday to cap off the holiday weekend featured several
  nail-biters as the playoff picture starts to come into focus. 
season: 29

      This game was not one of those nail-biters. It’s still smooth sailing for
      the Light Blue cabin crew – air beats sea as JetBlue Holiday gets a
      decisive victory over Navy Heather. The reigning number ones nearly ran
      out of room on the scorecard in their 39-6 win, led by Jordan A’s three
      TDs and Ryan W’s two. We’re begging for some turbulence, but so far
      Michael B and Kristin L are proving to be expert pilots.

      Royal Blue is heating up, winning four straight after a 2-2 start to the
      season. They held off a solid Forest Green team this week with the help of
      some clutch picks and a 2 TD, game MVP performance from center Jordan F.
      Can JC and his court ride this strong play back to the throne, or will
      they get usurped again by another contender?

      Big comeback win for Neon Pink this week, who I’m ranking behind JC’s team
      mostly to give Wyatt bulletin board material. Zo & Co pulled out the win
      in a chippy game that featured Chad M. continuing his dominant form with
      four touchdowns and a pick. With a deep group of extremely capable
      athletes (and also your intrepid reporter) flying slightly under the
      radar, it might be giving Spring ‘25 again?

      Kelly Green gets back on track, pulling one out against White in the last
      minute with a calm and collected Matt R at the helm and big contributions
      from Kevin H and others. I’m curious to see what a team with a talented
      rookie QB and this seasoned veteran core can do in the playoffs. Did the
      Collard Queens get their recipe right? Is there enough ham in it? Who is
      the ham in this metaphor? Much to think about.

      Purple stayed in the driver’s seat for most of their game against Neon
      Pink but couldn’t pull it off in the end. Luis did Luis things despite a
      continued lack of players, a four-man rush in his face, and Zo effectively
      working the refs. It’ll be interesting to see what Plump n Dump looks like
      at full strength – can their stock go higher or should we be selling now?

      Cardinal bounces back from last week’s debacle despite an inauspicious
      pick on the first play of the game. The crash-out kings won an important
      matchup against Seafoam anchored by two TDs and two sacks from Juan
      Burgundy’s MVP race-leading namesake. These guys are scary if they can
      keep their heads on straight (or gay but like, level).

      What’s your team supposed to do when someone like Andy A goes down with an
      injury? If you’re Ben H, you just throw to everyone else. These were
      smashing pumpkins on Sunday with contributions from a wide range of
      players, headlined by two picks and two TDs from Brandon R as they made
      Coral just a rat in a cage. Do they lack the firepower now to make serious
      noise in the playoffs, or was famously disruptive diva Andy holding them
      back this whole time?

      Aaron’s rocket arm wasn’t enough to fend off the Jock-O-Lanterns on
      Halloween weekend, leading Coral to the dead center of the rankings for
      now. Brian W led the team with a strong two-TD, two-sack performance.
      There’s plenty of talent here, the question is just whether they’ll put it
      all together for the playoffs or end up sleeping with the fishes.

      Things are starting to look a little slippery for our favorite amphibians,
      as they drop a close one this week to a strong Royal Blue team despite
      three TDs from Joey H and two sacks for Drew C. They still feel a bit like
      a sleeping giant, but time is running out – will they hop to the next
      level, or will their defensive struggles leave them stuck in the swamp of
      mediocrity?

      Seafoam washed up with a loss to Juan Burgundy this week despite Jamal and
      Zak’s best efforts. Reports indicate that Austin P was running for his
      life against Cardinal’s rush. But it was still a close game, much like the
      Green Bay Packers’ loss to the Carolina Panthers at Lambeau Field this
      week, which I mention here for no reason in particular.

      White’s losing skid continues with a last-minute loss to Kelly Green
      despite a strong showing from Chris D and Cam B sacrificing his body to
      the football gods on an impressive catch. The committee is struggling to
      find new ways to say that this team is…fine.


      Elite name, though.

      Don’t look now, but Sapphire has won two straight since Brandon M
      channeled the GOAT Serena Williams at the midseason party. Is there a
      correlation? Almost definitely. Blewchie Coochie looks to be trending
      upward, with Chris D finding his sea legs at QB and leading the team to a
      big win against Iron Gray. But can they keep it up when they’re playing
      top seeds instead of qualifiers?

      Ehhhhhhh. Yes, they beat a beaten-up, bruised, and barely still standing
      Black team, but it took some last-second heroics from Andy Pa. to claim
      their first win in five weeks. The committee will need to see more from
      them before we believe they’re shining like they’re supposed to be.

      Iron Gray gets a memento mori from Sapphire this week after finding the
      fountain of youth before the last two games. Notable Young Person Ed A led
      the scoring with two TDs while Dave W pitched in on defense with three
      sacks. Can they get a burst of terminal lucidity for the playoffs, or is
      this their death rattle? And how long can I keep pretending I’m younger
      than them for this bit?

      I was rooting for you! We were all rooting for you!


      But the league’s most likable, merry band of sailors followed up a big win
      by pulling an Edmund Fitzgerald against Light Blue this week. Mark J had
      three sacks against a great O-line, so that’s cool at least. I blame
      Andrew G for sinking y’all by saying such nice things in last week’s
      rankings.

      Despite Terry Yaki’s slayage (both in lewks and at cone), Black loses
      again, and the Glass Tiger curse continues with an Austin A leg injury.
      The Baddies either put up a strong defense or mildly inconvenienced a
      sloppy offense before tossing a game-ending pick at the five on a
      last-minute drive. They’re better than their record – we hope we get to
      see them at full strength with all casts removed soon, and anything can
      happen in the playoffs.


      But will it really, though?
