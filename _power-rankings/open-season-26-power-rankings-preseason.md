  Aaron Sayama:  Footballers – welcome back! Excited to take the field with you
  all this weekend. In the spirit of our first game falling on Oscar Sunday, the
  most auspicious of Gay Holidays™, let’s give out some pre-season Oscars:
season: 26
week: 0
rankings:
  - team: _teams/s26-royal-blue.md
    record: JC Adams / Oliver J.
    text: >-
      This Oscar season finds our reigning champion QB, JC, atop our Power
      Rankings. Paired with league veteran, Oliver, hard to see how they don’t
      end up in the Final Four. Maybe winning will tempt this team’s captain to
      show up to more than one social event! And, if not, I do know that this
      team's roster of social butterflies will be populating League functions
      until May.&nbsp;


      The Oscar for Best Performance at 2am on Kiki’s Dance Floor goes to Royal!

  - team: _teams/s26-cardinal.md
    record: Cameron M. / Lamar Riotta-Rogers
    text: >-
      I can feel it, third time’s the charm for Lamar and Cam! And, if they
      flame out in the playoffs again at least we know Chris, Aubrie, and Kevin
      will be serving lewks and jello shots on the sideline.&nbsp;


      The Oscar for the *Interstellar* time loop goes to Cardinal!

  - team: _teams/s26-purple.md
    record: Andrew Aldrian / Connor Wilson
    text: >-
      A young and earnest captain meets an older battle-hardened and football
      obsessed father. A budding (b)romance develops. Dotted with the occasional
      shady barb and sideline tête-à-tête, this captain and QB lead their team
      through it all.&nbsp;


      I’m buying my ticket to see this film.&nbsp;


      The Oscar for Best Performance in a May-December Relationship goes to
      Purple!

  - team: _teams/s26-black.md
    record: Austin Plier / Thomas L.
    text: >-
      *Extremely Luca Guadagnino*: A man runs across a sun-dappled field,
      dodging the gentle divots and passing defenders. He turns his hips, then
      his shoulders, he locks eyes with his quarterback, hands raised in a
      perfect diamond shape. The ball sails. Its arc is slightly above his head,
      but our receiver raises his hands. Contact. He comes down with the ball;
      the field opens before him as he pivots and lurches forward. He crosses
      the endzone. Touchdown.&nbsp;


      If Pedro cannot fulfill his duties, I am more than willing to be the
      Zendaya to this Josh O’Connor/Mike Faist duo.&nbsp;


      The Oscar for Best Performance in DCGFFL’s version of *Challengers* goes
      to Black!

  - team: _teams/s26-white.md
    record: Oriya C. / Michael Bromell
    text: >-
      Really, I’m not sure who can run down this team. With Bromell, Oriya, and
      Kevin on this roster, this team is racing faster than your dad/daddy’s
      favorite recent car movie *Ford vs. Ferrari* or his other favorite movie,
      *Ferrari*. Unlike those Oscar flops, we’ll see if white can cross a finish
      line.


      This year’s vroom vroom, faster daddy Oscar goes to White!

  - team: _teams/s26-dark-grey.md
    record: Matthew C. / Matt C.
    text: >-
      Matt and Matt will surely be sharing beard oil and trading various earthy
      colognes they found in different odds-and-ends stores in Williamsburg.
      What do we think their favorite Bon Iver songs are?


      The Oscar for Best Performance in a Lip Sync to Skinny Love goes to Dark
      Grey!

  - team: _teams/s26-lime-shock.md
    record: Ben Hunt / Jorge Membreño
    text: >-
      Allies that are just happy to be here and feel included. Incredible
      amounts of supportive yet stern dad energy. For their sake, let’s hope
      that anywhere else (Whitlow’s) they’d be a 10 doesn’t apply to their
      points per game.&nbsp;&nbsp;


      The Oscar for Best “Just Ken” goes to Lime Green!

  - team: _teams/s26-neon-orange.md
    record: Bryan Sanders / Sean Holihan
    text: >-
      This pairing and roster has all the trappings of a Coen Brothers film if
      I’ve ever seen one: comedy, drama, eccentric characters, optimism vs.
      nihilism, self determination vs. natural forces, a prodigal son (Carr)
      returning, Holihan vs. his knees.&nbsp;


      The Oscar for Best Team with *Burn After Reading* vibes goes to Neon
      Orange!

  - team: _teams/s26-olive-green.md
    record: Brian Hotchkiss / Juan V.
    text: >-
      Freshman captain Juan and veteran QB and teacher-of-rookie-captains Brian
      are an odd yet intriguing pair. The roster heightens the drama as, by my
      assessment, it’s a mixture of tiktok influencers and wayward cast members
      of *Cocoon*. A real faculty/student pick-up game kind of vibe.&nbsp;&nbsp;


      The Oscar for Best Performance in a Re-Creation of *The Holdovers* Dynamic
      goes to Olive!


      ![](https://media3.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExd2lhazhmMG1paGVlZDg4NjB0aHZvN2MxZWRreHl5dHlmajBweGN6dyZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/Ntz3UFvRV75SUC8BDa/giphy.gif)
  - team: _teams/s26-yellow.md
    record: Andy Pratt / Christopher Daniel
    text: >-
      Our anime loving captain, Chris, will surely appreciate the Studio
      Ghibli-like aura of his team: a menagerie of players across generations,
      an unknown captain/QB dynamic, but some magic may develop!


      The Oscar for Best Transformation from Unknown Team into Successful
      Business Witch goes to Yellow!


      ![](https://media3.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExaHo2NGh6emdmbWsyejFvN3hoZWwwOXpuMm5qNTFkNnA2dW1uejFmaCZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/Sh7eq63da4iJO/giphy.gif)
  - team: _teams/s26-marine-green.md
    record: Nick Perovich / Brandon M.
    text: >-
      Brandon is in the hunt for a Final Four appearance, and Nick had a strong
      first season, ending up just shy of making it. But can Brandon propel Nick
      forward as he looks to avoid a sophomore slump, or will this season just
      end up being their *Tenet*?


      And, the Oscar for Visually Interesting but Ultimately Hollow Season goes
      to Marine Green!

  - team: _teams/s26-forest-green.md
    record: AJ Reust / Levert James
    text: >-
      Honestly, I just imagine this captain/QB duo as having Maverick and Goose
      bravado.&nbsp;


      The Buckle Up It’s Going to be a Ride Oscar goes to Forest Green!


      ![](https://media0.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExeHIybWs5eWE0MDB0MGJ5djUzOTMyMW9jM2s4NWVrdnkzYXR4bDFyNSZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/26AHCgWcYM1xSqMaA/giphy.gif)
  - team: _teams/s26-light-blue.md
    record: Brandon Waggoner / Luis Cotto
    text: >-
      Brandon, Marvin, and BB on one team recalls one of the most epic war
      sagas, *Saving Private Ryan*. Three former Generals from years gone by
      coming together to bring their cherished cadet, Luis, to the promised
      land. And just like that opening sequence, the games at Carter Barron
      create a feeling where you don’t know who will come out alive.


      The Oscar for the Band of Brothers goes to Light Blue!


      ![](https://media4.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExanZicmd6d3VscTV0cXpqaXNpeW4yZ3pqcnF6Mm9hM3hrOXNmdzVkcCZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/ID8a7WRy7W3ug/giphy.gif)
  - team: _teams/s26-coral.md
    record: Garrett Schiponi / Derrick Johnson
    text: >-
      The DMV’s premier party DJ, DJ, drafted an all-gay team! Well, with the
      exception of his QB. Let’s hope that as the season develops those silky,
      funky, punctuated beats induce some *Whiplash* and bring Garrett over to
      the dark-side.&nbsp;


      The Oscar for Best Performance in the Straight to Bi to Gay Pipeline goes
      to Coral!


      ![](https://media4.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExeWptdTZpOHd4NWxwazF6dmVsYWpjcmY5OGF0dmJ2Y2R6dWI4cHN2dCZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/5ojhyxUmlMhqlVlA3P/giphy.gif)
  - team: _teams/s26-atomic-blue.md
    record: Aaron Billingsley / Tiger Ricchetti
    text: >-
      We love an entirely new management team stepping up to lead! I do fear,
      however, this team might end up in *La La Land*, though, as Aaron explains
      football and Tiger dedicates himself to writing his one-man show.&nbsp;


      This year’s Oscar for Unrealized Dreams goes to Atomic
      Blue!<br>![](https://media3.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExc2llYno0NnFmNHI4OWg4ODU5ZXJzOTR5a25ucnpmdXk5eThsdnMzdyZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/l44QvFam1JXtKYNna/giphy.gif)
  - team: _teams/s26-seafoam.md
    record: Patrick Shilo / Kevin Penny
    text: >-
      You know, I bet this captain/QB duo gives really good bear hugs.&nbsp;


      The 100 Acre Wood Oscar goes to Seafoam!

  - team: _teams/s26-neon-pink.md
    record: Jim Connolly / Justin Parker
    text: >-
      Both Justin, as part owner of two of our sponsors, and Connolly, as a QB
      in the League since season 1, are known by virtually everyone. It’s their
      web, and we’re all just trapped in it. Let’s just hope, though, that their
      season turns out better than the reviews for the new cult-classic *Madame
      Web*.


      The Oscar for Researching Spiders in the Amazon goes to Neon Pink!


      ![](https://media0.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExOTdnMGNrYnVkaXk0MW91azk5M3lmOHBoamI0cXJkY2JrM2FiNjJnbSZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/YVAPiSCzRLSDZOzj0W/giphy.gif)
  - team: _teams/s26-vegas-gold.md
    record: John C. / Trey P.
    text: >-
      It doesn’t take much to see the *Anatomy of a Fall* to the bottom of the
      power rankings here. But, maybe I’m like the distraught son: blind to the
      possibilities of this team.&nbsp;


      The Oscar for Impending Doom but still a Site for Rich Discussion goes to
      Vegas Gold!
