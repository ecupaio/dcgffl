    Caroline Blue went 3-0 this week as they defeated Black and a despondent Danny H sat on the sidelines in a boot. Are the straight dads really about to run this league? We’ll circle back after our bye for THEE game of the week: Carolina vs. Cardinal.

    This unlikely pairing of QB Bryan S. and Captain Vincent is really working. The White Team soundly defeated Fire in the Hole (Red) this week to go 3-0...? Reader, I am shocked. Is Vincent finally leading a team capable of going all the way?
