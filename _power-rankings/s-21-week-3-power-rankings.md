    Caroline Blue went 3-0 this week as they defeated Black and a despondent Danny H sat on the sidelines in a boot. Are the straight dads really about to run this league? We’ll circle back after our bye for THEE game of the week: Carolina vs. Cardinal.

    Until then, here’s a live look at that Blue weather report:

    This unlikely pairing of QB Bryan S. and Captain Vincent is really working. The White Team soundly defeated Fire in the Hole (Red) this week to go 3-0...? Reader, I am shocked. Is Vincent finally leading a team capable of going all the way?

    This purple team is full of newbies, and the combination is working. With all of their speedy running backs, someone is going to have to shut down their short game. Petition to re-name the team starts now:

    Last week’s #1 team was felled by a team wearing Neon Orange of all things. A couple of tough calls kept this game low scoring and showed that despite a star roster, anything can happen. Extra points really do matter.

    With their fearless leader back this week, Shipfaced didn’t even break a sweat for this lopsided win. Don’t sleep on Keith H--he may be adorable, but he’s got a monster arm.

    Man, the deCLINE was swift with this one. Blew Ball Busters (Carolina Blue) are tough, even Matt C’s deadly accurate throws couldn’t cut it this week. Maybe if Tom L. learns how to catch, they’ll start making strides again.

    Shady Pines showed signs of life this week! A truly exciting possession by possession, interception after interception, nail-biting game. Rookie QB JC Adams worked both sides of the ball, while Bradley found his way in for 2 sacks...or was it 3?

    The Iron Ladies really battled it out this week. Newbie Amanda D. is lighting up the field (and the social scene)! While they lost this game, they kept things interesting with some impressive plays and gusto. Andy seems to have worked out some kinks in his QB game during the _off season._ Margaret Thatcher would be proud.

    Fueled by the spirit of Celine and the physicality of Brian S., this team took down last week’s top-ranked team. QB Pat repeatedly found his receivers open in the middle. I know they walked off the field feelin’ themselves.
