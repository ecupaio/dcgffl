    I called it from the beginning, so y’all can run the tape back on that, but here we are.

    Poor Brandon Waggoner. We all wanted this for him. Will this league ever have another gay QB on top?

    It’s giving...[bad art friend](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/05/magazine/dorland-v-larson.html), it’s giving...kidney.
