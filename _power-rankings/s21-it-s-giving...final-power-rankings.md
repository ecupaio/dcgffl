    I called it from the beginning, so y’all can run the tape back on that, but here we are.

    It’s giving...fate, it’s giving...inevitability, it’s giving...mostly straight.

    Poor Brandon Waggoner. We all wanted this for him. Will this league ever have another gay QB on top?

    It’s giving...disappointment.

    Offensive player of the season, Keith H, had a monster season, but did the cracks on this team really showed in their final match, and, so, maybe they really were nothing to write home about all season.

    It’s giving...almost there, it’s giving...generic, it’s giving...J Crew Factory

    Improbable though it was, this team ended up in the Final Four. And that’s about all there is to say.

    It’s giving...trainwreck.

    he should be proud. They gave everything they had to each other...on & off the

    For the team that had a self-purported reputation of “niceness,” they surely weren’t that nice on the field. Helmed by a guidance counselor and a teacher, they certainly led some very physical offensive and defensive plays. What are the ethics of that?

    It’s giving...[bad art friend](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/05/magazine/dorland-v-larson.html), it’s giving...kidney.

    No one really wanted this team to go further than they did, not even their captain.

    It’s giving...up.

    For a team that was as demoralized as it was, they certainly pulled off an upset, but that was about all they could do..all season.

    It’s giving...mediocre.

    Charlie Salem Award Winner Scott Graham and League Legend Earl Armstrong coached and carried this team through a fun season, but lost in a surprise upset. What a tragic end, but, here’s to hoping their rookies will be back next season.

    It’s giving...Ted Lasso.

    The story here is always about AJ and Twon, but, on the whole, they were tame(r) this season. And, while no one wanted to see them win a championship again, we did see that look of anguish on AJ’s face after they lost. Gotta say I felt some schadenfreude there.

    It’s giving...growth, it’s giving...emotion, it’s giving...sad girl energy.

    Iron’s record might not accurately reflect their performance this season, but they were a force, and each of those losses were close and hard fought. We tip our hat to the veterans on this team who led, and to our Female MVP and new Social Chair, Amanda Dafonte, for her enthusiasm and gusto.

    It’s giving...warm and fuzzy, it’s giving...Joe Heron.

    This was an odd couple of a captain and QB pairing, and with multiple false starts this season, nothing ever really gelled here.

    It’s giving...odd couple, it’s giving...inconsistent, it’s giving...Congress.

    but, alas, it was...far from enough. Maybe they should’ve had a better cheer?

    This team really did try, though.

    It’s giving...backyard football at the family function
