    Steph and Brian are helming the team that’s on everyone’s lips this season: the Cardinal Care Bears. “Team Nice” has some truly star players in Cam, Chico, Kori, Stacey, and Raj, and, more importantly, Brian has got the experience and the tactical mind to know how to use them.

    A lot can happen in this league that shifts dynamics, but the question everyone has after watching them play: are they headed straight for the S21 championship? Who knows, but, in the meantime, they sure are fun to watch!

    OG DCGFFL’r, Tony Britford, and veteran QB, lovable “Ally of the Year,” and post-Achilles tear Ben Hunt have certainly drafted an intriguing team this season...of mostly straight dads.

    But these last two games haven’t exactly been challenging for them. While we shouldn’t discount the strategic mind of Ben Hunt here, the question remains: what will they do when they’re faced with a more evenly matched team?

    have led their Black team to 2 victories, but with a recent injury of a star player
    and leader on the field, are we about to see their quick deCLINE?\n\n  \n![](https://media4.giphy.com/media/jX8jTn63SF1f7Cnzcy/giphy.gif)"

    This week, white was able to fend off a challenge from the Navy team to a comfortable 32-21 win, but are Vincent’s newly acquired cakes able to keep the competition sated for the rest of the season?

    Purple had a tougher week against the formidable Iron Gray team, but cracks are beginning to show. Will the First Lady of the League™, Scott, be able to adjust and keep this winning streak?

    Iron Gray forced a nail biter this week, but if we look closer, we can just see Sean K carrying the team on his back.

    No one is thirstier for a championship than Brandon W. He’s our very own Susan Lucci, and we’re excited to watch it (not) happen this year!

    These sailors were without their Captain and never seemed to really leave port this week. Are they LOST in the sauce until he returns?

    Team Sean Cody led by Austin and JC haven’t really lit up the field like expected, but there’s still time! See below to understand the tension.

    This team seems to have a lot of players who are MIA. Thanks for being a friend?

    Jorge’s pending nuptials clearly have him distracted on and off the field, leaving QB Ben M to fend for himself. But, really, Ben moved away and moved back and only has 1 win to show for it. Maybe the Denver league was actually easier?

    Our subLIME team is certainly feeling acidic after these 2 losses. A near QB meltdown this week had the whole field like:

    Royal Blue just couldn’t handle it this week. Maybe they’ll get the Silky Nutmeg Ganache edit this season? Or, maybe, they’ll just drink a lot and have a lot of fun.

    Atomic Blue is sure feeling the blues. Their newly minted QB isn’t quite jelling on the field. We know Tony is whispering to himself

    Neon Orange didn’t even have a chance this week playing against Tony and Ben. The whole team is begging for a new day to come:

    Kelly Green can’t keep a QB to save their lives, and they are in desperate need of a leader on the field. Team prayer circle, anyone?
