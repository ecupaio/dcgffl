    Steph and Brian are helming the team that’s on everyone’s lips this season: the Cardinal Care Bears. “Team Nice” has some truly star players in Cam, Chico, Kori, Stacey, and Raj, and, more importantly, Brian has got the experience and the tactical mind to know how to use them.

    A lot can happen in this league that shifts dynamics, but the question everyone has after watching them play: are they headed straight for the S21 championship? Who knows, but, in the meantime, they sure are fun to watch!

    OG DCGFFL’r, Tony Britford, and veteran QB, lovable “Ally of the Year,” and post-Achilles tear Ben Hunt have certainly drafted an intriguing team this season...of mostly straight dads.

    But these last two games haven’t exactly been challenging for them. While we shouldn’t discount the strategic mind of Ben Hunt here, the question remains: what will they do when they’re faced with a more evenly matched team?

    have led their Black team to 2 victories, but with a recent injury of a star player
    and leader on the field, are we about to see their quick deCLINE?\n\n  \n![](https://media4.giphy.com/media/jX8jTn63SF1f7Cnzcy/giphy.gif)"

    This week, white was able to fend off a challenge from the Navy team to a comfortable 32-21 win, but are Vincent’s newly acquired cakes able to keep the competition sated for the rest of the season?

    Purple had a tougher week against the formidable Iron Gray team, but cracks are beginning to show. Will the First Lady of the League™, Scott, be able to adjust and keep this winning streak?
