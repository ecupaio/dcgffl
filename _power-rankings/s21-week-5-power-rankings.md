    Tony B and Ben H are seemingly unstoppable, as they sit as the League’s only undefeated team. They easily and deftly handled the Silver team this week in a 42-6 blowout. With just Forest Green and Royal Blue ahead of them, it’s pretty likely they’ll be rolling into playoffs with an 8-0 record, but, as we all know, playoffs hit different, and Ben H has never made it out of the semi-finals. Will this be the year?

    Purple hit the field with something to prove and this was THEE match-up. Purple death-dropped and split all over that field to put a stop to White’s winning record. And, yes, they did score from there.
