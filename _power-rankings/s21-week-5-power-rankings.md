    Tony B and Ben H are seemingly unstoppable, as they sit as the League’s only undefeated team. They easily and deftly handled the Silver team this week in a 42-6 blowout. With just Forest Green and Royal Blue ahead of them, it’s pretty likely they’ll be rolling into playoffs with an 8-0 record, but, as we all know, playoffs hit different, and Ben H has never made it out of the semi-finals. Will this be the year?

    Purple hit the field with something to prove and this was THEE match-up. Purple death-dropped and split all over that field to put a stop to White’s winning record. And, yes, they did score from there.

    While one of their players might have lost a tooth during this game, Levert and Keith made sure to fill the gaps here to a narrow win over Lime. Levert could be heard on Sunday at Dirty Goose talking about how the A Division is “so much harder.” Maybe so, but we’re looking forward to seeing who stands out in a couple of weeks.

    I’m sure the White team’s GroupMe has heard quite enough from this team’s captain, but maybe they should not have had a mixer the night before a big game?

    After back-to-back losses, the Care Bears seem to be back in-sync and taking down teams with their relentless positivity and some clever playmaking. If only they could tighten up that defense.

    Helmed by Derrick J and Pat S, this team has seen quite the climb. Pat played safe and smart, and with the help of a lackluster defense from Forest, Orange was able to clinch a win. Will they be able to maintain consistency from here on out to climb even higher?

    Tough loss for Forest Green where the team just couldn’t find its groove. Live look at JC at Dirty Goose after this game.

    A messy W is better than no W, right? (See: Tempe, AZ 2021)

    It all came down to one call on whether or not Twon was in bounds on a 2pt conversion. I think we’ve all seen this movie before.

    Trainwreck has exactly 7 plays and, well, each and every one of them worked on this Kelly Green defense.
