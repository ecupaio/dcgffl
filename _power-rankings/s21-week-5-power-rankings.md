    Tony B and Ben H are seemingly unstoppable, as they sit as the League’s only undefeated team. They easily and deftly handled the Silver team this week in a 42-6 blowout. With just Forest Green and Royal Blue ahead of them, it’s pretty likely they’ll be rolling into playoffs with an 8-0 record, but, as we all know, playoffs hit different, and Ben H has never made it out of the semi-finals. Will this be the year?

    Purple hit the field with something to prove and this was THEE match-up. Purple death-dropped and split all over that field to put a stop to White’s winning record. And, yes, they did score from there.

    While one of their players might have lost a tooth during this game, Levert and Keith made sure to fill the gaps here to a narrow win over Lime. Levert could be heard on Sunday at Dirty Goose talking about how the A Division is “so much harder.” Maybe so, but we’re looking forward to seeing who stands out in a couple of weeks.

    I’m sure the White team’s GroupMe has heard quite enough from this team’s captain, but maybe they should not have had a mixer the night before a big game?

    After back-to-back losses, the Care Bears seem to be back in-sync and taking down teams with their relentless positivity and some clever playmaking. If only they could tighten up that defense.
