    Coming off of a pillow-biting win, Purple handedly took care of business this week, moving them into this week’s #1 spot. Here’s the team’s response to congrats at Dirty Goose:

    While Carolina Blue had a rough game *cough 2 INTs on Ben H*, this team has consistently proven themselves. 5 Ws is still a tremendous record, but the cracks in the offense are wide open now. With Cammas not making it for playoffs, will this team be able to adjust?

    They had a shoestring team this week, but, honestly, 7(in) is all you need.

    Tough loss for the team this week, but Levert and Holleran are a force on the field. As we round out the season, they are certainly a team to track through playoffs.

    Goodness, what a Cinderella story of a game! With JC’s parents on the sidelines, the team rallied around and won by sheer positivity and heart. In a _Friday Night Lights_ moment, it all came down to 2 extra points with seconds left. Captain Austin P ran a crisp route with a perfect catch that sealed the deal for a W, leaving the sidelines stunned.

    Creeping up in the rankings is Brandon W, who, even without BB and Del, has been making strides. A solid W this week over Gold puts them within spitting distance of the Top 5.

    Andy Pratt’s new father status must have also come with the manual _What to Expect when You’re Quarterbacking_ because he looked great this week leading his team to a W over Navy. Joe H’s yelling at the refs notwithstanding, of course.

    Never say you can’t build a team around Joe Owens. Joe’s 6 touchdowns over Neon Orange feels just a tad disrespectful. Here’s Joe and team around TD #4, probably:

    Despite a forceful rush, Neon Orange couldn’t stop this trainwreck.

    Due to a forfeit, they had an easy W. Hope they had a relaxing Sunday!

    With almost a full roster of players and a team that is slowly gelling, they overwhelmed Black to a comfortable W this week. TBD on how well this team will hold with a couple of tough matches still to come, but, in the meantime:

    Amanda and Jorge’s wedding really took the wind out of the sails here. WIth Cline MIA and Danny H out for the season, Shane L stepped up as QB3 and was able to lead a pretty solid offense during the second half. How do we get Shane to QB next season?
