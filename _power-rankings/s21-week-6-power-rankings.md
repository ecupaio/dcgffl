    Coming off of a pillow-biting win, Purple handedly took care of business this week, moving them into this week’s #1 spot. Here’s the team’s response to congrats at Dirty Goose:

    While Carolina Blue had a rough game *cough 2 INTs on Ben H*, this team has consistently proven themselves. 5 Ws is still a tremendous record, but the cracks in the offense are wide open now. With Cammas not making it for playoffs, will this team be able to adjust?

    They had a shoestring team this week, but, honestly, 7(in) is all you need.

    Tough loss for the team this week, but Levert and Holleran are a force on the field. As we round out the season, they are certainly a team to track through playoffs.

    Goodness, what a Cinderella story of a game! With JC’s parents on the sidelines, the team rallied around and won by sheer positivity and heart. In a _Friday Night Lights_ moment, it all came down to 2 extra points with seconds left. Captain Austin P ran a crisp route with a perfect catch that sealed the deal for a W, leaving the sidelines stunned.
