title: 'Season 23 Power Rankings: Bye Week Special'
author: 'Stephanie McDaniel & Sasha Buchert - Well, after two weeks of football and
  approximately four long years, we are now halfway through the regular season. And
  it has been… weird. Rainstorms, heavy winds, hurricanes, forfeits, and games on
  saturday? Lucky number 23 I guess. We’re just glad the bye week is over and that
  we can get back to football this Sunday. At least our travel team brought back some
  hardware from Gay Bowl. Anyhoo, below is a look ahead at this week’s games.      '
season: 23
week: 4
rankings:
- team: _teams/s23-black.md
  record: 3-0

    include whether JC will be able to walk after a weekend of basketball (and a silver
    medal!) and the degree of wildness we can expect to see in Andrew’s hair.\n\n

    The Foamosexuals are clearly used to scoring but there are some unanswered questions about the notorious Foamosexuals that will be decided on Sunday. Chris M. really knows how to re-enter the league. With the commish and a deep bench on their side, what could go wrong? Should be an awesome game. Too bad it's at 9 o’clock in the morning.

    the crew keep the momentum going? With the REAL Pratt back in action, we don’t
    see why not?! Just to be clear, we’re talking about Linda, not Andy.\n\n  \n![](https://media.tenor.com/nZhlbp0mXYEAAAAC/fire-beyonce.gif)"

    of mind is whether Britt will be wearing those awesome sunglasses defenses often
    only see from the back and whether Bobby will have his outfit together in time
    for the game. It’s a serious question.\n\n  \n![](https://media.tenor.com/u8uX3PwguFwAAAAC/glasses-sunglasses.gif)"

    Lingering questions remain such as whether the weather will be warm enough for
    Chris to wear “the shorts” and whether Adam will scare any of the new players
    while demonstrating the proper techniques needed to demolish a rusher. \n\n![](https://media.tenor.com/KTEOrfEo8hkAAAAd/sataoa-laumea.gif)"

    Ben and crew are off to a fabulous start and Dan’s bandana is ready to go. \n\n

    on everyone’s mind is whether de-Amanda can will this team into a team of destiny?
    Cam certainly has the weapons, but the Gworls are going to be tough. \n\n![](https://media.tenor.com/usIHRXr3ue4AAAAC/you-cant-run-from-your-destiny-face-the-truth.gif)"

    Blue World Order takes on Cocked & Loaded Limebackers (2-0) this Sunday. Ben is really coming into himself as a QB this season. I mean, have you _seen_ those football-slinging, flag-pulling, money-making biceps??? It’s just unfortunate that this Blue World doesn’t include any women+ in it…

    We might have to rename Big Mouth Billy Bass with the way Clem sings and flops all over the field. Hopefully having some of their zen players back on the field with them this Sunday will bode better for Rick Royal’d (0-2) and keep Clem in check.

    their double header against the Shady Birches (1-1) and Yellow Brick Loads (1-1)
    this Sunday. Will Hotchkiss’ new offense keep marching down the fields? Can this
    stellar defense hold the opponents at bay? One thing’s for sure, somebody will
    come out of this weekend with a winning record! \n\n![](https://media.tenor.com/Q4bx2G_ZiQsAAAAd/winner-winner-turkey-dinner-beth-dutton.gif)"

    Good thing this team has the late game against I Run Gay (2-0) on Sunday, because they’ll surely need their rest after visiting the Red Light District in Hawaii this past week. Will Brandon be fully recovered by the end of the season?? Let’s hope so, because this team really needs a win.

    The Sandra Bullocks will be bumping uglies with the Yellow Brick Loads (1-1) this week. The question here is: Will Ms. Bullock will be proud or embarrassed by their performance? I hear Vincent’s been doing parachute runs again in preparation! We’ve all missed those cakes…

    this weekend. Can they weather (get it?) a double header in only their second

    players’ names a month after they first played?\n\n  \n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/yunLFq5tevAsw/giphy-downsized-large.gif)"

    A tough double header faces this team hungry for action after a long layoff. A game against last year’s champion QB and the current #1 team will test a team that hasn’t won a game contested on the field. Luckily QB Andrew is used to double the action and can tap into those twin daddy energy reserves to face the challenge.

    for JC to break what has to be approaching a record losing streak. Maybe Sean
    Karson’s return from a strong showing in the Gay Bowl will provide the inspiration
    they need to end this streak and kickstart their season.\n\n![](https://media.tenor.com/RXFTK7OMSKYAAAAd/orbit-streak.gif)\n\nWell,
    buckle up buttercups, the rest of Season 23 should prove to be “interesting” to
