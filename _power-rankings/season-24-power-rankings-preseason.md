  Aaron S. - Season 25 is upon us Leaguers, and we’re very excited to welcome
  you all back. In honor of this momentous occasion, welcome to the DCGFFL
  Preseason Eras tour! Let’s visit each team as we all prepare for Sunday. See
  y’all at Carter Barron at 9am sharp!

      Larry and Cam play together in travel, and they drafted some familiar
      receivers to this team. They’re in their “recycle era” for sure. It’s
      going to be plug and play for them this season and, barring a playoff
      flame out (again), my money’s here

    record: Twon H. and JC Adams
    text: >-
      JC is going to have figure out an offensive scheme and really stick with
      it, but I think he’s got a good coach and mentor in Twon. The D on this
      team is going to be tight and tough to penetrate. Of course, the real
      question is whether or not JC/Noah survive this season—it’s certainly a
      choice to draft your boyfriend! But with Noah AND Munroe on this team, who
      is going to watch Kal when White takes the field?

      I’m going out on a limb here and calling Concrete Grey a Top 3 team.
      Admittedly, Honeycutt as QB is a bit of a wild card, and he’s been out of
      the game for a minute, but wow is this team stacked. Jared, Kevin,
      Bradley, and Linda know exactly what they’re doing out there, and I
      definitely don’t want to meet this team at full strength. No matter how
      they do this season, though, I bet they’ll be drinking for free at Dirty
      Goose.

    record: Derrick Johnson and Cam M.
    text: >-
      Cam can make even the most novice of receivers look like stars on the
      field. That said, he’s just going to throw to Nikki, and there’s no reason
      not to. The real tea, though, is that this is going to be Team Sunday
      Funday.

  - team: _teams/s24-royal-blue.md
    record: Bryan Sanders and Bradon Waggoner
    text: >-
      At this point, Waggoner’s commitment to ensuring the average age of his
      team is around the age one should be getting regular colonoscopies is
      remarkable. Hopefully this team’s experience will come in handy! Sanders
      is coming off a championship win, and he might be just the one to help
      Waggoner fine tune his system to finally snatch the trophy that’s eluded
      him for so long.

    record: Evan Binder and Austin Plier
    text: >-
      Your author this week missed scrimmage (sorry, babes!), so I can’t give
      everyone the full run-down, but I have faith we’re out to surprise some
      folks. While I’m really hoping Austin’s midwestern nice will balance out
      Binder’s sort of craven attitude on the field, I’m just excited to play
      with some exceptional women: Camille, Em, and Aubrie!

      Yes, a very adequate team will take the field. They will win (some) games.
      Not sure about much else, though.

      Ladies and Gentlemen, please welcome to the stage: Team Villain. JC is
      going to need to hand out a lot of favors to get folks to ref this team’s
      games. Best of luck!

    record: Matt H. and Wyatt Eck
    text: >-
      Nothing confirmed, but this team might be a bit of a dark horse this
      season. I’ve heard some grumblings about this Captain/QB draft placement
      and that some players…might have undersold themselves. Fully hope Wyatt is
      dangling invites to future vacations based on performance!

      Aw, gotta love #teamnice. IDK if they’re winning many games, but they’ll
      be nice to play against. I couldn’t imagine a more perfect foil to Atomic
      Blue.

    record: Tony Britford and Malcolm Warbrick
    text: >-
      IDK what to really make of this team because the roster is very good, but
      Malcolm is an old DCGFFL QB making their return after many years away.
      Your writer is impossibly young—the youngest power rankings writer DCGFFL
      has seen, in fact—so I wasn’t here for his tenure. Though, even if he was
      really good years ago, football is not really a game that one ages into.
      But, hey, I’m open to surprises.

      Goodness there are a lot of personalities on this roster. I would watch a
      season of “Hard Knocks” featuring this team, though.

    record: Jim Roll and Pat Shilo
    text: >-
      I’m glad Pat Shilo is back! I’m not sure Jim will be after a couple of
      games, but this is a fun roster, so the vibes will be good even if winning
      isn’t in the cards! And who doesn’t want more Baby Lucas?

      I poured over this roster and could find nothing cohesive here. Not sure
      that bodes well for the rest of the season.

      The talent on this roster might inspire Trainwreck to breathe some new
      life into his playbook.

      Really just going to watch these games to see if the number of penalties
      Cam gets this season is over or under the amount of words we hear from
      Andy and Kenny combined.

      I hear Michael is captaining an undefeated team in the DC Gay Basketball
      League. Hope he’s lowered his expectations for this experience!

      This is the leadership duo that took the DC Warriors down to Florida to go
      1-5. That W was a forfeit, but, hey, a stat is a stat is a stat. They can
      only go up from here!
