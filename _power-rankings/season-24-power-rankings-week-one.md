author: 'Chris Riotta - Well, well, well, what do we have here? A bunch of busted
  Bunker leftovers and their unfashionable allies once again prancing around a field
  for some balls. What a rousing first weekend…I almost wasn’t bored for a full minute.
  Now, buckle up and put on your Prada sunnies – I’m about to throw some serious shade. '

  text: I lost count after the game entered its 450th overtime, but Boat Stuff eventually
    anchored down and sailed its way to victory. The Daffodilfs tried to stay afloat,
    but in the end got fully docked by this surprisingly tough crew of maritime misfits.
    I’m letting y’all have the top spot this week since you basically played a double
    header and won – but don’t get cute about it.![](https://media.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExNTA5YmRhNGMwNDM5ODc4MTUzZWZjMjQyYTNkYjU0MTVlODY5ZGIwNyZjdD1n/4lnudKjDARe7tBLqJg/giphy.gif)

    “All the small things” Pink 182 did to secure a win led to their “first date” with victory for the season. Congratulations to Tiger for “fighting the gravity” and surviving a record-setting singular game without enduring an injury. Knowing your luck, I'll be ordering a fleet of medical staff to the field in advance of next weekend.

  text: At first their energy was giving sub, but these Dom Trops eventually dominated
    the game and took home their first trop-hie of the season. While I'm highly skeptical
    there are any actual dom trops on this team, I'm looking forward to seeing how
    far and long (and wide) y’all can last.

  text: Even with an illegal amount of straight dads on this team, Popping Cherries
    proved too fruitful on the field as Concrete Grey failed to harden its defense.
    The Cherries took home a sweet victory, with a hellish defeat that left its opponents
    wishing Jesus took the wheel.
- team: _teams/s24-silver.md
  record: 1-0
  text: Silver got lucky and struck gold in this close and aggressive matchup. The
    team came out shining thanks to Marvin's silver bullet skills and some impressive
    plays across the board. However, since I suffered a minor injury at the hands
    of this team, I will be immediately filing a lawsuit with the intention of bankrupting
    them ahead of the playoffs.

  record: 1-0
  text: It looks like Pit Crew's engine just couldn't keep up with Kelly Green's speed
    in this game. Jim Connolly, J.J. and Mike Osorio led their grandchildren to victory
    this week in what can only be described as an adorable moment for America's senior
    citizens. (This message has been sponsored by AARP.)

    Y'all had your diva cups on so tight, you made your opponents projectile all over Carter Barron! I'd be upset had I been forced to play on that field after your victory, but since I wasn't, I'm exclusively impressed by your team's audacity. Congratulations on this hard-fought win, and so help me God if you are as aggressive during our match-up.

    Starting off the season with relentless rushing and a pick six?! These daddies need to seriously chill! This team's offense stayed cool as ice during a nail-biting game that saw the chillest daddies come out on top in the end.

  text: This team rained on their sunny competitors and left team yellow feeling rather
    blue during an honestly pretty boring match up. I wasn't all that impressed by
    your performance, and I ran out of my iced coffee halfway through your game. That's
    on you.

    A perfect score to start the season during a game that was otherwise torturously too long to endure. I really don't need to write anything else. Your score is literally "69." Just be proud of the hard-fought match y’all put up.

  text: This loss was personally soda-pressing for me; despite my team's fantastic
    efforts, orange creamsicle uniforms and bubbly personalities, the silver team
    showed off their metal in a hard-fought game. But we won't just be left chasing
    rainbows – ours is officially the underdog team to watch this season.

    don''t plan to be on top? It''s a bit too derivative IMHO, especially given your
    team roster. That said, here''s hoping you don''t get royally screwed out of a
    victory next week.'

    What’s the DCGFFL guidelines for cleaning up gameday vomit on the field? Personally, I think the responsible players should be made to do it themselves as the rest of the league chants “SHAME!” from the sidelines. That is the only way forward after someone projectiles like this team’s captain did on Sunday during a gut-wrenching game. (Here’s hoping your sense of humor is stronger than your stomach, Evan.)

  text: What's sad is that I would not have many shady things to say about the guys
    on this team had their performance not been so utterly boring. I think there is
    some potential on the purple team – that is, the potential to be a consistent
    letdown to their sideline supporters. Luckily some of your personalities are more
    impressive than your performance on the field.

    What a drag. Pit Crew tried to rev up their offense, but failed to shift gears in time to edge out a win against older, apparently wiser opponents. Is this team the dark horse of the season, or have they already run out of gas?

  text: This game was a real nuclear explosion that left the Atomic Blue team in the
    fallout. Unfortunately this team just couldn't quite split the atom of victory
    during a close game. Y'all didn't have the energy or nuclear fusion between your
    offense and defense to pull off a win, and that's sad for you.

  text: This team's quarterback appeared to be too transfixed on the opposing twinks
    to secure a victory. Furthermore, Ron from the opposing team suffered a small
    incision on his finger, and since his family is almost certainly from New England-generational-lawsuit-wealth,
    I can guarantee Neon Yellow now has a fierce enemy in the league.
- team: _teams/s24-concrete-grey.md

    Concrete failed to lay the foundation for a victory as its offense and defense both cracked under the pressure in a stunning defeat. The team didn't seem to have a game plan set in stone, leaving its players feeling mixed up against their opponents. Here's hoping they can solidify a few wins over the weeks ahead, but right now it is so bad, I want to give you a zero.
