  Chris Riotta-Rogers - Well, well, well, it’s finally September! Spooky season
  is just around the corner, Pumpkin Spice lattes are back on the menu at
  Starbucks and The Gays have all returned from their annual sacred pilgrimage
  to Rehoboth Beach. That can only mean one thing: The DCGFFL Fall Season is
  upon us! (Unless you ask our shirt vendors, in which case: The DCGFFL Women’s
  + Fall Season is upon us!) Who better to cast out the summer sun and serve up
  your first week of power rankings than your favorite shady witch?

      I promise you that giving this team the \#1 spot hurts me more than anyone
      else. I mean, my team of strategists wrestled around the clock to find
      some way that we could possibly avoid giving my husband the top billing
      for another week in a row, but he is unfortunately and unarguably on the
      top team to watch this season. We get it, you guys are athletic. Cam led
      his team to victory with well-executed plays and that boyish,
      Americana-football player style that sideline fans have come to know and
      love.&nbsp;


      I will be rooting for your demise.

      Something about this team is giving me underdog vibes. Is it their lithe
      bodies galavanting across the field and somehow securing a healthy victory
      over formidable opponents? Could it be the work of rookie and potential
      rising star Brandon Recto? Will Camille be forced to carry the entire team
      on her back all the way through the finals?&nbsp;


      Possibly, probably, and almost definitely.

      This team of twinks and trash talkers may just have the charisma,
      uniqueness, nerve and talent to secure a spot in the championships, but I
      want to make them work for it a little more. There’s an air of privilege
      amidst all of that great hair and good looks that I can’t fully support
      just yet. Sure, you guys had a great game, but like, stop being so pretty
      about it.

      I have been advised by my lawyers not to speak about the violent attacks
      that my QB leveled against his boyfriend on the field due to my closeness
      to the situation. However, I will say that JC’s commitment to victory at
      all costs – even if it means pummeling Noah into the ground, and finishing
      him off as he recovered on the sidelines, just to ensure his total
      annihilation – is nothing short of admirable and heroic. Some people would
      be embarrassed or feel ashamed about attempting to kill their partner so
      publicly for the pure sake of winning a football game. But not JC. Nothing
      but respect for my president!


      Ask yourself this: If Navy Blue is willing to physically destroy our own
      lovers, what do you think we’ll do to you and your team?

      Seafoam had a fantastic showing during its first game of the season,
      gaining a significant lead against its worthy opponents during a
      well-fought match. The same cannot be said for the team’s captain,
      however, who TMZ found boozing it up with his boo and the bourgeoisie in
      Napa Valley at a straight people's wedding all weekend. Will Seafoam
      continue to rise above the waves, or get dragged down to the bottom of the
      ocean by its MIA captain?

      The silver team refused to fall into a black hole, instead climbing up the
      rankings this week after a powerful showing on the scoreboard. I'll admit
      that I didn't watch this game whatsoever, and none of my sources in the
      field reported back much drama, besides a few injuries among your
      opponents. Boring! You guys won't get anywhere in this league without
      adding a little bit of flair and edge to your game.&nbsp;


      Next time, go for the jugulars! (My lawyers have advised me to express
      here that I do not condone violence in any way, shape, or form.)

      Word on the street is that the Maroon team ain't nothing to f\*&k with!
      Still, facing a team absent a leader, I was hoping for more of a blowout
      (or at the very least, a happy ending.) I still have high hopes for this
      squad, and I expect their strength to grow throughout the season.

      I’ll admit again that I did not get to see this game, but seeing as though
      your roster is full of 10s, I’ll be sure to catch the next one. I will say
      that your reputation unfortunately precedes you; Ryan Winter was caught
      bragging at Shaker’s about his victorious play over Sean Karson on a
      single post.&nbsp;


      Ryan, a word of advice: Let your success move in silence. Nobody likes a
      sore winner.

      Most of this game was like edging: There was a whole lot of back and
      forth, but very little climax. Rookie Andre Brown seemed right at home and
      looked like he might even be the dom in the relationship, while Alex P's
      presence was hard to miss as he zipped around the field like a golden
      bee.&nbsp;


      Hoping the Gold team is showered with a few more Ws this season.

      This team had a lot of trash talk to say after LOSING to Navy Blue about
      the amount of sacks they got. And sure, they got more sacks than a
      designer handbag clearance sale. They got more sacks than a brunch buffet
      has mimosas. They got more sacks than children who have Nick Cannon as
      their father. You get the point. But guess what, y'all still lost, and you
      might be officially down a whole player if JC continues to have his way
      with Noah. I’d watch out if I were the rest of you.&nbsp;


      (My lawyer is now encouraging me to drop out of the league and flee the
      country.)

      A friendly, close game that was as boring to watch as it is to now write
      about. I want to make fun of you guys for losing, but this team is giving
      sportsmanlike conduct.&nbsp;


      I swear, half of these teams brought the fire and ice to the first weekend
      of games, while the rest of you made it seem like we’re some sort of
      loving community that treats each other with respect and kind intentions.

      Like a bottom claiming to be a Power Vers, the Neon Pink team almost
      flipped the script from bottom to top with an epic final drive, but in the
      end could not secure the money shot. Both teams seemed to be playing like
      they were on a first date after a 20-year-relationship-gone-wrong: Not
      quite sure what to make of each other or whether touching would
      immediately be considered inappropriate.&nbsp;


      Loosen your Neon Pink soles a bit for the next game and try to have some
      fun out there.

      Despite both the captain and quarterback for this team looking like they
      could play main characters on Friday Night Lights, these alleged
      footballers didn't have the game knowledge and stamina in real life to
      bang out a win. There's a whole lot of potential on this team, and some
      sure-fire skilled athletes that can help take home a trophy (looking at
      you, Applewhite). Hopefully Lime can squeeze out a few Ws this season.

      This team seems to have all the right parts, but lacked the unity
      necessary to take home a first week victory. With Captain Jim and QB
      Mike’s many, many, ***many*** years of experience, I was expecting a bit
      more out of this team. There are some power players here who should not go
      unnoticed, and a few rising stars to keep tabs on as well. But without a
      tad more organization, communication and verve, I'm not sure red has the
      heat to match fire with fire.

      Seafoam ran through this team’s defense harder than a leftover twink at
      Bunker’s last call. QB Andrew couldn’t quite get any offensive plays to
      stick, leading to a pretty devastating loss. Is this coral reef going to
      bleach and die like the rest of them – we shouldn’t be making puns about
      climate change, it’s really serious, guys – or can they work miracles
      together and build a new foundation?&nbsp;


      Much like Mother Nature, I am losing hope in coral.

      Finally, some drama! Sure, your team was trounced and lost in a pretty
      miserable defeat to Sapphire. But you also racked up unsportsmanlike
      penalties and calls for unnecessary roughness, which we love to see! (My
      lawyer is now having a full-blown panic attack.) Keep at it, and you will
      have a loyal sideline fan in me for the rest of the season. Or get your
      act together and you might still have a shot at coming back, though that
      option sounds far more boring.

      You guys had to know what you were doing when you decided to give your
      team the name “The Black Holes.” Buckle up, this is going to get messy:
      The Black Holes were left battered and bruised after some rough digging
      from the Silver team left star players Tracy and BB bent over and
      incapacitated. I wanted to see you shine, but I guess what they say is
      true: No light can escape a black hole.&nbsp;


      Pucker up and practice your kegels – The Black Holes have a long, long way
      to go.

      Talk about a fall from grace. This team has all the makings for a final
      four challenger, but the captain is asleep at the wheel. Captain Joe has
      now missed the draft, the TAP party, the first practice AND was late to
      the first game (which he ***literally*** overslept for.) Joe, a word of
      advice: Entire civilizations have crumbled due to leadership vacuums, and
      your gays are currently absent a king.&nbsp;


      Dust off your crown and get back in the game.
