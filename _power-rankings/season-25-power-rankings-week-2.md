  By Darryl P. and Andrew H. - It’s your Men’s+ Rookie of the Season (XXIV),
  Andrew with your favorite DCGFFL drag mother, Jazzmin St. James D’Monaco
  (Darryl) coming in hot with your Week 2 rankings.  The games were just as
  unpredictable as the weather on Sunday. And, after the board sent an email to
  reiterate the flagrant personal foul and unsportsmanlike conduct policies, it
  seems some players *slams laptop close ‘til Monday* and didn’t get the memo.
  Oh well, in the spirit of camaraderie, community, and positivity….here’s a
  bunch of shady comments about how you all played. 
season: 25
week: 3

      **Andrew-** Spring 2023: JC Adams wins his first game by 1 point and his
      second game by 8 points. Fall 2023: JC Adams wins his first game by 1
      point and his second game by 8 points. Will the pattern continue all the
      way to another championship? Let’s hope not.

      Kevin Penny is pacing the team with 4 touchdowns already (despite his
      quarterback seemingly getting flagged for illegal forward passes or flag
      guarding nearly every other play); it’s amazing how well you play when you
      don’t have to drive 8 hours to every game. Welcome to town, Kevin

      **Andrew-** After being on the villains last year, it’s nice to be
      associated with a team known for their good looks and great hair
      (unfortunately, I don’t contribute to either category). Our offense has
      only been stopped once in our first two games and our offensive line and
      rushers have been phenomenal. Connor seems to have remembered that he
      isn’t supposed to injure his own teammates or drop 3-4 balls a game and
      already has 25 points, doing whatever he can to win Rookie Captain of the
      Year (what other captain bakes sweets for his teammates?? no comment on
      how they taste, but at least he’s somewhat thoughtful). I am a \*tad\*
      worried for later in the regular season, when both our captain and our QB
      decide to take vacations and miss a combined 3 games. Also, shout out to
      Patrick for not forcing us to arrive early to set up the fields. Although,
      I still would have, because someone needs to win the Teacher’s Pet Award.

      **Andrew-** After two convincing wins against seemingly good-on-paper
      teams, this team will (hopefully) find their winning streak come to an end
      against the Tar Heels this Sunday.&nbsp;

      Pat Shilo hasn’t turned the ball over yet this year, 4 different defenders
      have already recorded interceptions, and the team is converting on 66.7%
      of their extra points. Not having Hofberg available for the Final Four
      weekend may dash this team’s hopes for a championship, but they can at
      least play spoiler and knock out top competitors on their way to the Final
      Four. I’m also purposefully not poking fun at this team or their players,
      because if they do beat us this Sunday, I’ll need a few weeks to recover
      from embarrassment.&nbsp;

      **Andrew-** Shhhh- do you hear that? That’s the sound of Matan screaming
      “BLOCK!!! LET’S BLOCK THEM!!!” to his team on the opening kickoff while
      completely whiffing on a block himself.&nbsp;


      ![](https://media.tenor.com/--n7vUGvxB0AAAAC/anchorman-loud-noises.gif)


      After a sloppy first half, team dads Ben and Matt rallied their boys to a
      come from behind win against the Plan Bees. This team will need to work on
      their endurance, though, if Ben keeps huddling his offense 25 yards behind
      the line of scrimmage. This team has a very easy next few weeks and will
      likely be at the top of these rankings until late October at the
      earliest.&nbsp;

      **Andrew-** Yes, this team is 2-0, but…not because they did anything
      special this week (more on this below) and I can’t in good conscience rank
      them in the top 4. Their drop is equivalent to Alabama dropping in the
      rankings this week after only beating South Florida by 10 points, after
      being favored by over 30.

      The big question is, will Cam and his team go full Texas and turn into the
      Cowboys in the playoffs, and completely blow their first round game? After
      a nearly flawless spring season, Cam has already thrown 4 interceptions
      through 2 games (yes, 3 have come on extra points, but still) and Tiger’s
      weekly Instagram story polls to touchdown ratio sits at a whopping 14:1.
      This team is good, but there are still plenty of chances to slip up.

      **Andrew-** I was \*so\* ready to compare this team to captain Bromell’s
      alma mater, Indiana University (which was recently named the worst college
      football team of all time)...and then they went and dropped 51 points on
      Sapphire. Tom H went absolutely off with 4 interceptions, Bromell added in
      3 sacks, and Coral completely drowned Sapphire’s offense with a 32-6
      halftime lead.


      ![](https://gifdb.com/images/high/titanic-goodbye-jack-hqb4inyk0nvnynh5.gif)


      This team’s defense will be the determining factor going forward, with 2
      out of their next 3 games being against undefeated teams.

      **Andrew-** I don’t know what halftime adjustments were made last week,
      but whatever it did worked as they got to the Disco Cowboys in the second
      half.


      ![](https://i.gifer.com/74wf.gif)


      Josh is putting together yet another solid year, Dwaylan and Art are
      packing a solid 1-2 rusher punch, but Wyatt is turning the ball over at
      nearly double the pace compared to last year. I don’t know how he can miss
      those bright lime jerseys, but the turnovers must come to a stop if this
      team has any shot at a solid winning season.

      **Andrew-** If we are going to talk about patterns, we have to discuss AJ
      falling apart in the second half. After a brillant first half against
      Lime, the Disco Cowboys stopped discoing- in the second half, 3 sacks, an
      interception, and a blown lead to lose the game.


      ![](https://media.tenor.com/v6tClCWwboIAAAAC/sad-tantrum.gif)


      Twon will always thrive in AJ’s “just get open, I’ll find you” offensive
      scheme, Brandon is a worthwhile rusher, and while Benny and Micah provide
      AJ with other offensive weapons, I’ll need to see consistency (and I’m not
      talking about consistently having poor second halves) before ranking them
      higher.

      **Andrew-** Let me first point out that this team does not have a SINGLE
      9:00 AM game this year while some teams have 4-5. Their one “early” game
      conveniently is the week where start times are pushed back 2 hours.


      ![](https://media.tenor.com/u5TNH9h9cCsAAAAd/sus.gif)


      While I am an objective ranker and don’t let jealousy sway me, this team
      isn’t just lucky when it comes to schedules, they are lucky in their two
      wins as well. Their two wins were a 2 point win against a winless pink
      team still reeling from whatever you’d like to call the earlier
      monstrosity and a 7 point win over the only other 0-3 team, forest. Throw
      in a 31 point blowout to Coral…and I think their record is a bit
      deceiving. Yes, you have Peter who can score nearly every play. Brandon is
      a solid WR2 and good candidate for rookie of the year. Camille is always
      capable of having a breakout game as she did last year. Ehhh-van B has the
      potential to catch a ball or two as well. But I’m not convinced this team
      is worth their current winning record.

      **Andrew-** Ryan Winter may not have been bragging about torching another
      top-tier defender during Sunday Funday again, but he is up to 4 touchdowns
      on the year which is nothing to scoff at. Despite their name, they seem
      like angels compared to nearly every shade of green, but with a plethora
      of fellow travel quarterbacks coming up on the schedule, their defense is
      going to have to step up their game because allowing 34 points isn’t going
      to result in many victories. Here’s hoping Cline’s team can finish a
      season this time around.

      **Andrew-** After a first half shootout which had them leading Gold 26-20
      at halftime, Marine’s offense disappeared just like that F-35 jet did this
      weekend (the Marine pilot survived the ejection) but somehow held on for
      their first victory.

      Rookie and local pickleball phenom Aaron B hasn’t quite figured out that
      this isn’t his D III football team and the contact allowed is far less,
      but nonetheless he is providing to be a worthwhile target behind Luis, who
      is torching safeties left and right on his way to 4 touchdowns through 2
      games. Hotch certainly has no shortage of receiver targets with these two,
      Tommy, and Michael, but they’ll need to learn how to score in both halves
      if they want to win these close games consistently.

      **Andrew-** Trey came out with a vengeance in week 1 after being ranked
      dead last with a performance of a lifetime…and followed it up with a
      sputtering performance in a loss to Marine. “Rookie” QB Nick has shown
      flashes of brilliance thus far, and his experience playing up north will
      result in the freezing Carter Barron mornings coming up feeling like a
      cool summer afternoon. This team won’t be blowing any opponents out, but a
      win is a win, and this team will certainly win some more.&nbsp; But if
      not, maybe Trey can put in for the new Golden Bachelor so he can find a
      win somewhere else.&nbsp;

      **Andrew-** After watching Sanders’ opening kickoff go straight out of
      bounds, I figured they were in for another rough morning. But… It’s
      amazing what this team can do when Joe shows up on time and Aaron can keep
      his mouth shut.


      ![](https://media.tenor.com/nOqopvFa9gwAAAAC/tyra-banks-be-quiet-tiffany.gif)


      Speaking of Aaron, after missing half of the spring season because he
      preferred to spend time with his Black-hawk friends, he’s now leading the
      team in touchdowns (and unsportsmanlike conduct penalties, but let’s focus
      on the positives). Yes, their dominating win came against Forest. But 8
      members of their team have scored at least once this season already- the
      ability to have multiple scoring threats is essential for a deep playoff
      run and especially when the injuries start hitting.
  - team: _teams/s25-yellow.md
    record: 1-2
    text: >-
      **Andrew-** Plan A- win the game. Plan B- be leading for a large majority
      of multiple games but then lose the game. Two 1-point losses to start off
      the season surely stings&nbsp; (ha ha ha), and a win against a lackluster
      forest certainly doesn’t instill much confidence in the eyes of the power
      rankers.

      But this team’s 3 pronged rush attack of Derrick, Noah, and Blake will
      wreak havoc for any cone they face. This team also has a very difficult
      upcoming schedule, but if Austin taught us anything last year, the regular
      season means nothing.

      **Andrew-** After a career year last year, Trainwreck’s numbers are way
      down this year. While the average time from catching the snap to ball
      release is down to an astonishing 0.7 seconds, Jim’s interceptions are way
      up, granted he can’t do much when the ball travels 2 yards, hits his
      captain in the hands, and ricochets into the defenders arms.


      ![](https://media.tenor.com/nQJHRuTrRf0AAAAC/trying-try.gif)


      This team has arguably one of the top 3 receiver duos in Sean and Johnny,
      but the opportunities for big plays just haven’t been there through the
      first two games. With more rain in the forecast this Sunday, I envision
      another day of quick slants and pitches for Red.

      **Andrew-** Going 0-2 against 2 good teams is nothing to scoff at…Ivan is
      pacing his team with 3 touchdowns, but this team just was not able to get
      to JC this week after a promising start to the year with 3 sacks in week
      1. Upcoming quarterbacks are equally if not more mobile, which could cause
      some issues for their secondary. The Black Holes are currently sitting at
      a brutal ⅛ when it comes to extra point attempts- last year, Kozak’s team
      was in the bottom 3 of XP efficiency as well. Some things never change.

      **Andrew-** The Dolphins’ Miami Miracle to beat the Patriots. Auburn’s
      kick-6 to beat Bama in the Iron Bowl. And now, Neon’s Messi Finish. While
      Pink’s giving away of a victory didn’t come against an arch rival like the
      other two, it will similarly live in infamy in the minds of everyone who
      witnessed it. Picture this- you are winning with 90 seconds left, and your
      opponent has 0 time outs. The ESPN Gamecast gives your team a 99.9% chance
      of winning. The opponent’s fans have already left and are driving home,
      listening to the game on the radio when the announcer goes, “NO! WHAT ARE
      YOU DOING?!?!” and suddenly your team loses the game. There’s really no
      logical explanation to how, or why, it happened. But it did. And now your
      team is 0-3, only above a team in the rankings who is losing games by an
      average of 20 points a game. Eeks.

      **Andrew-** Have we ever seen a team just completely give in this early in
      a season? In Sunday’s doubleheader, Forest got outscored 53-6 over the
      duration of 2 halves. Clem threw, what I assume to be a league record, 8
      interceptions over the two game set, most of which appeared to be the
      referee’s fault, based on him yelling “you’re killing me, man!” over and
      over.

      He did pick off two balls himself which helps his net interception total
      slightly, but he’s going to need some better defense around him if this
      team has any shot of turning their season around. On the plus side, this
      team is now down to averaging only 1 unsportsmanlike conduct per game. Did
      Levert see how well the supplemental draft worked out last year for
      Tropic, and figured, “why not?”
