  Tiger: Happy post-25th anniversary everyone! Hope everyone has gotten some
  much-needed rest afterward and had a fabulous time connecting with DCGFFL
  players past and present.   Pete: I hear it was a fun-filled one! So glad to
  see you’ve come up for air to write these rankings with me.   Tiger: In
  consideration of all those involved, we appreciate you respecting our privacy
  at this time. We have all separated and wish each other nothing but health and
  happiness going forward. This is a private matter and I have not nor will I be
  making any further statements to the press or others at this time. Thank you.
  Kisses. XOXO.

      This team never wants the foam party to end. With a good number of options
      to work with, QB Ben Hunt decided that winning by two scores with less
      than a minute left wasn’t enough and proceeded to try and run up the score
      even further. It’s No Foamo, it’s YOLO, it’s dance like nobody’s watching
      from the sidelines, it’s two bros sitting in a hot tub, five feet apart
      cause they’re not gay (or foamosexuals, whichever you prefer).

      Oriya continues to sneak his way past all his opponents into the endzone
      and Paul continues to put in WAY too much effort by throwing his body all
      over the field. Whether it’s sheer skill or everyone getting distracted by
      Team Twink’s boyish good looks - it’s working. These boots (heels) be
      walking all over the competition and pretty privilege remains alive and
      well.

      We hope Jordan’s back doesn’t hurt too much from carrying this team. But
      you have to give them credit, when they eventually have everyone present
      they will have all the pieces necessary to make a serious run at the
      championship - but can they run as fast as gays do from commitment? Only
      time will tell.

      We get it - another JC-helmed football team with a talented bench and a
      so-far undefeated record. We’ve seen this show before, we’ve ridden this
      merry-go-round, this has already been written about, and it has rarely
      resulted in a championship win (ok…maybe ONE time). See y’all at the final
      four and then godspeed from there!

      Game 1: They were there. That’s about it. Orange you glad this team got
      left on Red.


      Game 2: Are you a twink that doesn’t go looking for danger, but danger
      finds you? Do you find yourself on the receiving end of a hard beating,
      but not the kind you wanted? Do you act tough only to start bleeding
      everywhere on the field AND on the sidelines? If so, please consider
      donating to the Justice for Twinks Fund (@Tiger-Ricchetti on venmo). My
      perennially sprained hand, thankfully not broken nose, and consistently
      over-dramatic but bruised ego (and body) thank you for your support during
      this difficult time.&nbsp;


      Pete: I’m shocked, SHOCKED to see you made this one about you. And I look
      forward to the indictments inevitably following your latest moneymaking
      scheme.&nbsp;


      Tiger: For just one dollar a day, YOU could help a twink in need.

      The Boy is Chaotic.&nbsp; Wyatt led this team to a bewitching 24-0 start,
      but in the end it was barely enough for the W, cuz no Lime points came in
      the second half, and none from an extra point.&nbsp; Without Josh Estryn’s
      Accio spell beaming nearly every tossup ball into his hands, things with
      Neon could have gotten Messi.&nbsp; And in case you haven’t noticed,
      there’s another rookie not to sleep on here: speedy short king Art.


      Tiger: Direct quote from Pete: P\*\*\* on me Wyatt.


      Pete: This is a private matter and I have not nor will I be making any
      further statements to the press or others at this time.


      Pete: MOVING ALONG, Honorable mention goes to: Team mascot Lucas, serving
      a fresh wig, cheering on his and our daddy from the sidelines.&nbsp;


      Tiger: This is a message we can all get behind in these bitterly divided
      midseason times. \#LucasForSpeaker

      Under consistent leadership from Jens and Matt Cline and consistent digs
      at the referees by Ken, Violet has managed to notch another victory under
      their belt. While their game against Coral wasn’t entirely coming up roses
      - they made sure that the other team was pushing daisies by the end. For
      all we know they may merrily skip their way through the fields all the way
      to the finals. But they’ll need to start sowing those seeds now. And maybe
      nip some of the sniping at the refs in the bud or they’ll come to learn
      that every rose (and annoyed ref) has its thorns.

      Tiger: Rookie Andre was running circles around an already beaten-down
      Black team this weekend. And they’ve been proving each game why they
      shouldn’t be underestimated. Could this turnaround be the boost the team
      needs to launch them into serious contention for the crown? Did everyone
      doubt this new quarterback too quickly? Did Carole Baskin kill her
      husband? We’re all eager to find out.


      Pete: Step aside Joseph Allen Maldonado-Passage, we have a new Tiger KING
      in town.


      Tiger: &lt;(•-•&nbsp; ) \*ahem\*

      For a team with some of the objectively nicest people in the league, they
      received a SHOCKING number of penalties this weekend - and boy did it make
      the girls feisty. Luis made some huge plays over White including a pair of
      60-yard TD runs, but his voice was louder still. This weekend definitely
      left the team with a sour taste in their mouth leaving the field and you
      can bet that they’re coming into next weekend hungry for that W. ** ** The
      theme was sour, sweet, gone.

      We will fully admit, we’ve heard very little about this team this whole
      season. Are they silent but deadly? Or are they fading into the
      background? With some big names on their roster, we’d like to believe
      they’re just flying under the radar, but we get the feeling that, at least
      so far this season, they might be going down with the Titanic.

      We had no idea AJ was so religious with the number of times he was yelling
      J\*\*\*\* C\*\*\*\*\* at everyone on his team. He was giving my
      pro-conversion therapy uncle a run for his money. Silver was able to rack
      up a solid lead in the first half, but let it slip in the second after
      some unfortunate drops and a pick six. Guess it just wasn’t part of god’s
      plan for them to win this one.

      I’ve never thought about it before but this is quite the eclectic cast of
      characters on this team - many who’ve made a name for themselves on and
      off the field. But strange bedfellows can yield surprising results - from
      Bromell’s shake and bake to this ominous quote from the sideline: “Andrew
      Aldrian is Mr. Rogers with a dark side” - we’re not sleeping on this team
      just yet.

      Watch out Travis Kelce, there’s another player in a red jersey that got
      put on the map on Sunday.&nbsp; This supplemental draft ringer gave Red
      their first win over a formidable Texas Orange, and he’s the muse to us
      sideline Swifties:&nbsp;&nbsp;


      October morning you showed out,


      Pocketless shorts, running effortless routes/&nbsp;


      You pull my flags and heartstrings,


      Sleeveless arms, now I’m sweating/&nbsp;


      Rookie only in name, catching balls and my gaze,


      This reception was immaculate, he’s my church on a Sunday.

      Captain Joe Owens was seen storming off the field mid-game due to the lack
      of defense his team was putting up. Or he was going to work? We’re not
      entirely sure which one. But without his leadership these little krispy
      kremes were left more disoriented than ever. Maybe their name is a little
      \*too\* on the nose..

      This team’s name also may have proved prescient.&nbsp; After the loss of
      one of Bees’ Knees (wly Noah), new supplemental rookie Ken proved to be a
      playmaker, and may be exactly the backup option this team knee-ded
      (sorry). Will his mojo dojo casa house Kenergy be enough to make a
      dreamland for Austin, DJ, and this group of kindhearted Barbies?&nbsp; It
      wasn’t enough for the W this time, but we’ll be watching.

      Struggling not with their backup, but the BACKUP to the backup
      quarterback, Black was already headed into the weekend outmatched and
      outgunned (which, according to the authors’ extensive extensive research,
      is the first time that word has ever been used to describe BB). It’s been
      a hot minute since refs have had to record a safety - and maybe that
      should be added to the ref clinic next season seeing as nobody had any
      idea what to do when it happened. These holes definitely took a bit of a
      beating this weekend, but they were all in good spirits at Sunday Funday -
      maybe it was the afterglow.

      Cheep Cheep Cheep. Neon delivered a Broadway level performance of
      Pick-a-Little Talk-a-LOT. In the second half, the air and emotional
      temperatures rose in tandem, leading Refs JC and Kevin to deliver them and
      Lime an unprecedented “no talking to the other team, periodt” gag
      order.&nbsp; As to the football of it all, they mounted an impressive
      last-minute turnaround, but like Jojo, it was more than just a little too
      late.&nbsp;


      We could say more but they already said enough. Team All Bark, No Bite
      this weekend.

      Forest gave Navy a run for their money this weekend, almost winning before
      dropping the ball in the last minute. Literally and metaphorically. Clem
      was heard yelling about LITerally everything but made sure to clarify he
      wasn’t mad at anyone on his team, he was mad at himself. We love a man who
      takes responsibility.&nbsp;


      This team is known for playing rough and hard, some might argue too hard,
      but if they play just a little harder they might surprise everyone with a
      second half of the season ride to the championship. Knock on wood.
