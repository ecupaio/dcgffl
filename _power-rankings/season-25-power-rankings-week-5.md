  watching (or missing) some on y’all Sunday, it looks like Seattle took a
  beating on you!! Well for those who came out and played, you gave us so much
  to talk about & I can’t wait to share all the good tea with you all. So
  without further addo…it’s time for another episode of - DCGFFL Weekend Update!

      Now listen, this team is cruising through the Pitcher’s Division with one
      of the highest point differences this season. But will this come to an end
      next week, when they go head to head with the other undefeated team in
      their Division, Maroon!&nbsp;&nbsp;


      With that being said, I do want to celebrate Chris R. getting his two
      sacks during the game. However, I cannot also help to think about poor
      Andy getting barreled over by Chris. You could tell that inner child was
      very happy with that knockover.

      If Navy has the Pitcher’s Division on lock, it’s looking as though
      Carolina is right in line with them in the Shaker’s Division. Oriya is not
      a stingy quarterback & Captain Connor still showing leadership, even
      though he’s suffering a sidelining injury. But it looks like Aubrie O on
      Carolina had themselves a DAY! Over 2 games: three TDs, an XP, and an MVP.
      However I’m sure that Andrew H. would probably want us to forget that
      awful ending to what could have been an amazing kickoff return for a
      score!!! I mean sir, you are too old to be tripping over your own feet…in
      the middle of the field…deep…no one near you…and right in front of your
      mother too!!!

      Ok, I will say that I am Salt Bae while I’m writing this post…& yes I am
      still bitter about it a few days later!&nbsp;


      So let me go ahead and say congrats to Maroon on that off play from Coral
      that allowed y’all to drive the ball down for the win.

      No but in seriousness, Maroon played very well. Even without heavy hitters
      like Mark Hofberg and Drew Crane, the team was able to hold their own and
      pull out a win. But it was funny when Jordan compared Pat’s run game to
      his throwing ability. Needless to say, I don’t think he’s anyone’s Forest
      Gump though!

      Well it appears that this week Andre lived up to his team’s brand,
      providing protection against a strong Red.

      Reports state that Andre was everywhere…if a ball was thrown by Red, Andre
      intercepted it. If a ball was thrown by Nick, Andre caught it and
      scored!!!&nbsp; So we raise a glass a to you Andre…while we side eye the
      rest of the team!

      \*Sigh\*...take it from someone who has personally experienced playing a
      game without Ben Hunt, it’s never fun. Watching this game instantly made
      me reminisce on one of my favorite scene from Mean Girls

      Lucky for this team, his absence was during the season (\*cough\* *Fall 22
      -White team* \*cough\*). Not to mention, Zach McRae actually showed
      potential as a backup QB and Aaron scored a TD this game!!!&nbsp; So I’m
      certain this team will bounce back next week when they take on Lime.

      The word being thrown around this team was: COMPETITION and this DC Elite
      led team held true to that word against Carolina. A very offense heavy
      game first half and defense heavy game second half, ended up with a 3
      point loss for Texas Orange. No real drama for this team in the game (*Boo
      Andrew*), although there was one call that was definitely in the air until
      push came to shove with the refs that ended up with a first down for
      Carolina and Texas Orange all up in arms.

      I must say, this is probably the most level headed team this season. I
      asked my field reporters to find out the tea on Marine, and they came up
      empty handed. It’s giving growth and I’m here for it!!! But listen
      Luis…next week when you play Red, you gotta come hard cause…

      But while we celebrate their double digit win over Lime on Sunday, there
      was some speculation about this one play from our reporters…

      Now according to this screenshot, this looks like a sack. But word on the
      street is that didn’t happen!! Hmm…

      Not a bad day for Purple. They went 1-1 on their doubleheader and Ocho was
      still able to contribute, even though he didn’t get to the first game on
      time.

      But this team got a great snag in OIiver during the supplemental draft and
      he has shown himself to be a worthy addition to the roster. But next week
      is gonna be an interesting test for the team when they go up against
      Sanders and Joe’s White team. Nevertheless we will be watching!

      First, we should celebrate their decisive victory over Yellow!!!
      **<u>Woo-Hoo!!!</u>**&nbsp;


      Now onto the Story of the Day- so after attempting to aggressively remove
      the flags off a Yellow player (to no avail and getting called out for it
      by the refs) Twon made his frustrations known to everyone.


      * Twon: “This is F’n football”

      * Everyone; “FLAG FOOTBALL!!!”&nbsp;

      * Eduardo: “You just need a hug Twon!”&nbsp;


      Luckily two plays later, Twon was able to reel in his aggression and was
      able to remove the flags with one swift grab. ***Moral of the story
      kids***: Soft touches work better when it comes to removing flags.

      So on one hand, I’m happy to see Sanders and Joe get another win under
      their belt and get their record to .500. However, I would have loved to
      see how this game would have ended if Seafoam had their QB present. Don’t
      get me wrong, I definitely think they could have still won, but the game
      may have been much closer and I’m sure&nbsp;&nbsp;


      But hey I love a win, by any means necessary…so guess what?

      Now don’t get me wrong, I appreciate this team’s love for a 2000s R&B
      classic (and FYI I will always do Monica’s part at karaoke).&nbsp;


      I really do enjoy this team, they have all the parts to be a successful
      team, including rookie player Art who is really coming into his own. There
      was literally nothing that could be improved on, so it's unfortunate that
      they lost both games on Sunday and their record is below 500.&nbsp;

      I must say, it was great to see the Honorable JKW and his partner Javi
      come out of retirement to referee the Sapphire game. But it seems as
      though in this courtroom, Sapphire didn’t have the evidence to win their
      case. First of all, it took most of the first half for the team to get the
      ball down into the endzone. Not to mention that this was Andy’s first game
      back in the QB position. But I have faith that

      \*Sigh\* Watching (*& playing in*) this game felt like I was in the story
      Cinderella. The fairy godmother came and gave the team the lead going into
      the second half, but she left them with one rule: *<u>you must hold onto
      the ball until the final clock strikes</u>*. As the game went on, Coral
      was enjoying the game, continuing to expand their lead, preparing to
      celebrate their happy ending by earning a win and giving Maroon their
      first lost. However, when the clock did strike midnight, the glass slipper
      fell into a million pieces as we watched the ball fall into the hands of
      Maroon for the interception, giving them enough time to score one more
      time for the win. And the team did not live happily ever after

      Ahh, our resident old heads team! Listen one thing about this team is they
      have the fundamentals down as the team was handing out sacks left and
      right to gold (5 stops and 6 sacks). But it appears that our living legend
      Jim had an unfortunate moment or two, which has kinda become par for the
      course.….guess Jim Connelly gonna Jim Connelly

      This team definitely has the star power to be successful with a phenomenal
      QB who I must say, could have a future in ballet the way he twirled around
      rushers with such grace.&nbsp;


      But when you’re going against Silver, it pretty hard to have any standout
      moments, and in this case a 12 point loss to them isn’t worth talking
      about. However, next week they're taking on Sapphire, so I got faith y’all
      going to turn the train around!!! Just remember

      That could literally be the entire post! But I’ll write a little more! You
      know, I was definitely worried about this team. The way their first four
      games went, I just didn’t think they were gonna catch a break this season.
      But look how the sunshine came in and they got a win!!!&nbsp;

      This team played Sunday with only 7 people, which according to Levert
      wasn’t their strongest members. Yet, they were able to get their smallest
      earn margin against a non-pushover Purple! I think we are on the verge of
      a 2nd half comeback for this team!!!&nbsp;

      Oh Kozak! You know I love you, my blocking partner in crime! But I’m
      concerned that you’re going to follow in the footsteps of Spring 22 Boats
      N’ Hoes (*DCGFFL History Lesson - they were the last team to have a
      defeated season, never winning a game*). Not to mention, your double
      header next week includes undefeated Carolina and an old guard Red team. I
      don’t know what you gotta do before next week but…
