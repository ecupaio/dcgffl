  Aaron Sayama - Thanks to a fantastic group of writers, I haven’t had to weigh
  in on our rankings since pre-season. So as our playoff picture comes into
  clearer focus, I decided to make my way around the fields on Sunday to see
  what I could glean from each of our teams. Here are the things I learned
  (TIL). 
season: 25
week: 6
rankings:
  - team: _teams/s25-navy.md
    record: 6-0

      ​​​​​​TIL:


      * JC can still pull out a W even while amidst the throes of a hangover and
      getting yelled at about the ref schedule.

      * Juan and Kevin are really good at football.

      * Chris Riotta-Rogers’ celebration dances have a heterosexual “the rent is
      due tomorrow” kind of urgency.

      * As right tackle, Aaron Ross stood planted like Adele at her Las Vegas
      residency. No sacks from this side, though!

      ​​​​​​TIL:


      * Connor’s commitment to the soccer mom bit is unparalleled.&nbsp;

      * Aubrie is THEE one to watch.&nbsp;

      * With Oriya out for the next 2 weeks, I expect this team to just try and
      make it to the playoffs healthy. We’re all excited to watch our Director
      of Players, Paul, line up under center, though!

      * Reigning Rookie of the Year, Andrew Hoyler, is the bobblehead, as Ivan
      snatched a ball from him for a pick 6 return, changing the momentum of the
      game.

      TIL:


      * Having your regular season QB makes a huge difference. (We love you,
      Zach; thanks for stepping up!)

      * Chris gets really mad at you if you run slowly and if the refs don’t
      call a block in the back, but he refuses to curse.

      * Captain Matt H makes Ben look good.

      * This is the best season QB Pat has ever had in the DCGFFL.

      * Jordan Anderson is also really good at football.

      TIL:


      * Rookie QB Nick has an arm! He needs some red zone plays, though.

      * Straight man and Rookie of the Year contender, Andre, looks good in a
      crop top jersey.

      * Sasha is slept on by defenders, but she is always in position!

      * Trey will lobby power rankings writers for recognition. Baby, let what
      y’all do on the field speak.

      TIL:


      * Bryan really drafted himself a set of tall receivers. No, but, actually
      men who are &gt;6ft and don’t just say that on the apps.&nbsp;

      * They don’t really play defense, however, as both of their games had
      scores of 35 points or more on both sides. Some west coast offense scores
      if I’ve ever seen them.

      * Mello and Brommell running after each other took me back to my carefree,
      whimsical elementary school days.

      TIL:


      * Mary in her high-ponytail puts in work!

      * Cam still throws some incredible balls to…no one. Lamar, sometimes, I
      guess.&nbsp;

      * Offensive schemes seem hard for this team to digest. Time to break out
      the sideline white board!

      TIL:


      * QB Hotchkiss has 3 offensive coordinators on this team and none of them
      are him.&nbsp;

      * Their drives take forever because, wow, is every second of that play
      clock used.&nbsp;

      * Ben M is a real swiss army knife – from QB to leading safety on this
      team! Who knew? Cheers to our Bostonian!

      TIL:


      * This team was happy to have Garrett back, and I’m sure this was the most
      welcomed he’s ever felt. Look at DCGFFL creating families!

      * Garrett was also on his Cam Newton with those rushing TDs!

      * Camille is finally off of the IR; Recto makes a return next week; and,
      hopefully, if Andy feels better, too, we should expect this team at full
      strength to make a statement before the playoffs!

      * Purple can hunker down! They just barely eked out this W over White in
      overtime.

      * Apparently, they’re some kind of defensive powerhouse with 4 picks–2
      done by Ryan Winter? Okay, athlete!

      * Brandon and AJ can actually stay calm when there’s drama abound! Come
      through, maturity!

      * AJ can actually take ownership of his throws. No Derek Carr yelling at
      his receivers to finish the route even though the ball was off target
      here!

      TIL**\:**


      * DCGFFL veteran Kozak can certainly look the part of coach as she sat
      along the sideline.

      * He is also apparently unnecessary to his team as they pulled out 2 Ws
      this week.

      * Participation from your QB, unfortunately, does make a difference

      * Jim Connelly needs some kind of feedback loop for plays. But, I mean,
      sure, if it doesn’t work the first time, it’ll definitely work the 3rd and
      the 4th times!

      * 58 yo Sam Smallwood is a starting corner next week as he was all over
      the field breaking up plays and with a pick six in their game against
      Marine Green! Let’s go, DCGFFL Sauce Gardner!

      * Obie sometimes likes to show hole while running for a 1st down.

      * Newly minted dad, Jorge, can run hip-to-hip with some very fast
      receivers, but does not know to turn around and bat a ball away.&nbsp;

      * PJ barks when we rushes

      okay, babe, you really were…so…close!

      abandoned!
