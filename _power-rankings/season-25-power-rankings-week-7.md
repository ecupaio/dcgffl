  Darryl P. - “Oooh yeah, fo’ shizz, fo shizz!” It’s your FUNtabulous, drag
  queen supernova (because I’m old) Jazzmin St. James D’Monaco delivering your
  BRITNEY JEAN SPEARS inspired Week 7 Power Rankings. As a southerner with roots
  in Mississippi, I feel it’s only appropriate. Don’t forget - Daylight Savings
  is on Sunday (11/5). Enjoy the extra hour of sleep.

      OMG! Another win for the Playboys on the field and a super cute win at the
      Mid-Season Halloween party. They’re becoming unstoppable, but next week’s
      game between Seafoam could reveal, if any, cracks in this team’s hull.

      My hat goes off to Seafoam. You only beat us (Maroon) by one point, but
      you played a great game. Going into next week’s game against undefeated
      Navy, do they have what it takes to hand them their first loss of the
      season?

      We’ve probably made a few comments about this team in our power rankings,
      but they had a great Sunday playing a doubleheader against Texas Orange
      (OT) and Gold. Both games were close and we all heard about them from
      across the fields… Exactly what you’d expect from another Twon and AJ
      duo.&nbsp;

      THREE! We’ve been the Game of the Week THREE times this season. Each time
      we’ve given you well-played games with close scores. TWO! We lost two
      games to the current top two teams in the league. ONE! We lost two games
      by ONE point and we always play as ONE team. The entire team plays a role
      in every win! Love yall!

      Rookie QB, Nick is having a great season. You can’t win them all, but he’s
      proven he can win most. A potential Game of the Week is their next game
      against Carolina.&nbsp;

      Ouch! I don’t have much to say about this game. Carolina had a lot going
      against them on Sunday. I understand your quarterback was missing, but did
      you get a few pitch plays down the field at least…

      Heading into the last regular season week, Marine Green has found
      themselves in the middle of the pack and proving to be a very competitive
      team. It’s giving…STRONGER THAN YESTERDAY!

      **Song: I’m Not A Girl, Not Yet a Woman, Year: 2001**


      You almost had Seafoam in the last few minutes of the game. Unfortunately,
      you gave them enough time to drive the ball down the field for a TD and
      the win.&nbsp;

      doesn't always go my way, yeah”

      After a couple of back and forth picks, Red came out on top against Lime.
      I hear this game was very positive between both teams. We NEED MORE OF
      THIS!&nbsp;&nbsp;

      From the sidelines it seemed Coral was having some intrateam disagreements
      which is odd because they got the win.

      This is a good team..a great team! Let’s hope by Week 8 you’re starting to
      get “NSYNC” with each other. \#oneband \#onesound

      **Song: Hold Me Closer, Year: 2022**


      Some mistakes and a missed catch down an open field might have lessened
      Texas Orange’s chances against their opponent. Although Silver got the win
      in OT, this team is stacked with talented defensive and offensive players
      - maybe people partied too hard over the Halloween weekend.

      **Song: Boys, Year: 2001**


      White played a very hard, tough game against Navy but just couldn’t grasp
      the win.&nbsp; Captain and QB pair Joe O. and Sanders were bringing it in
      the stats this week...save something for the rest of your teammates,
      though…

      **Song: Break the Ice, Year: 2008**


      Uber drivers in the DMV are NEVER reliable (even during a scheduled
      marathon) which resulted in a late QB for Sapphire.


      ![](https://media.tenor.com/UExPD35OV7cAAAAC/long-drive-road-trip.gif)


      They were able to “break”Andy P. out of retirement to step in as
      quarterback for most of the first half. Upon Garrett’s arrival, they
      turned up the heat on Maroon, but ultimately fell short.

      **Song: Lucky, Year: 2000**


      This is a story about a team named “Neon’s Messi”. With only six players
      present, they managed to walk away with their second win of the season.
      Could the absence of Carolina’s QB have played a part in their victory? A
      win is a win

      **Song: (I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction, Year: 2000**


      I’m not sure what happened here. Winning their first two games of the
      season during a double header weekend last week, this doesn’t look like
      the same team. Where is the energy?&nbsp;

      **Song: I Love Rock N Roll, Year: 2002**


      A team of ‘good-time-guys/gals’ gave it their all against Red, but
      unfortunately couldn’t pull off a win. No worries – I hear they all found
      solace in post game chicken baskets and a bucket o’ beer at Nellies. We
      love a team who enjoys Sunday Funday!

      Sometimes you have to sacrifice your body to help your team win - thanks
      Blake! Sometimes you have to know where your end zone is located when you
      intercept the ball – poor Judy. Though, most times extra points are
      important and being short two points doesn’t feel great.&nbsp;
