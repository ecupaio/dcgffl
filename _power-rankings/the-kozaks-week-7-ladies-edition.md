    Can you believe Gay J didn’t draft any ladies?! Yeah, me too. We love Capt. Darryl though, so we’ll let it slide…here’s some badass ladies of the league anyway.

    Amanda D. is the heart and soul of Iron Curtain. Even though she was a little hungover this past Sunday, she still brought a high level of energy to the team. She even got called for an illegal rush when she wasn’t rushing on that play. Hmm, who reffed that game?? Her speed and enthusiasm are huge for this team. Capt. Joe is right to want her in the running for Female Rookie of the Season!

    Blackbeard & the Booty Pirates have had a tough season, but they’ve been rallying thanks to Caroline! And let’s not forget everyone’s favorite sideline morale booster, Sam C., who got their dog into a rainbow costume for the game!

    Shantal and Yvette make this football thing look effortless, but don’t be fooled by their cute faces. They’re fierce underneath! The Cadet Kellys are lucky to have these two.

    Veteran Fatima and Rookie Holly are the glue for Celine Neon! With Holly’s sure hands, you’d think she’s been playing in the league since the beginning. Fatima brings some savage speed. These ladies are not to be trifled with.

    Blue-m for You is hanging on after a tough loss to Carolina. Nadja plays a key role on this team. Her offensive blocking and ability to read the field helps to set up some clutch plays!

    Silversatile’s league veterans, Jayme and Nikki, help hold this team together, while Annie rounds them out. In Capt. Jorge’s words, “The term rookie doesn't quite apply to our defensive minded, Raven loving, tequila swilling bad ass...Don't let the dimples fool you - she already has your flags.” If only this team had a few more games before playoffs, I think they’re really finding their stride.

  text: The Golden Gurls are really missing Tori, who had a season-ending injury.
    I guess the next best female shout out on this team is Mop Top’s wife who just
    had a baby! Maybe we could get New-momma M out there to help this team.

    Ashley always brings her A-game. She was a rusher, blocker, linebacker, and receiver all in one game this past week! And wore a badass mullet wig...if you don’t know her, you should.
