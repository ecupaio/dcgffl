    Blue-m for You is hanging on after a tough loss to Carolina. Nadja plays a key role on this team. Her offensive blocking and ability to read the field helps to set up some clutch plays!

    Silversatile’s league veterans, Jayme and Nikki, help hold this team together, while Annie rounds them out. In Capt. Jorge’s words, “The term rookie doesn't quite apply to our defensive minded, Raven loving, tequila swilling bad ass...Don't let the dimples fool you - she already has your flags.” If only this team had a few more games before playoffs, I think they’re really finding their stride.

    I guess the next best female shout out on this team is Mop Top’s wife who just
    had a baby! Maybe we could get New-momma M out there to help this team.

    Ashley always brings her A-game. She was a rusher, blocker, linebacker, and receiver all in one game this past week! And wore a badass mullet wig...if you don’t know her, you should.
