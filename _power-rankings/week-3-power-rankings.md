    a row?\n\n  \n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/gNXjGzyfOVtePiD0YE__jyYkzMqwKgsFpYCGJCXbN5gQ-oySYIWXMrrjJ3fykS65tBhJ_2Q3cUZpfPw8D_7rzn-3O80c21wtGrdaulq0NZTn87IruNXZzluSGPbb3sFY21s13Afl

    I don't know about you, but this team may win season 22” (Taylor Swift's Voice). You can see Dwaylan making sacks on the field and twerking at the bar. Not only a star in name, Connor Starr shined bright on the field while sporting a shoulder brace and finishing the game. From talent to determination, I wonder who’s going to beat this team.
