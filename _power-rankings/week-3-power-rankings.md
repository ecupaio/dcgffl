    Fwhorest Queens? Or Drama Queens? Somebody call Bravo, I think we’ve found the Real Housewives of DCGFFL. Levert, Quinn and John Riley have all earned their spot on the show due to arguing with the refs. Let's hope Forest Green and the refs are on the same page by the mid-season party.

    Chrome wreckers may have secured a 1 point win over Pink, but they got their chrome wrecked in their first game. So bad in fact the other team brought in Sean, their Captain, to QB the later part of the game. Might be time to turn the hoopty into the junkyard boys or at least get a tune up.

    If bitter was a color... it’d be Pwink. Consistent losses have plagued this team and I don’t just mean their games. With multiple injuries they struggle to get their feet under them. We didn’t expect them to be this low and we bet they didn’t either. Hopefully they can pull it together next week.

    If you want to be a riff on Khia’s one hit wonder you’re going to need at least 1 win. With 3 losses, this team is sadly dragging behind. Maybe week 3 will be their one hit. New Chant Alert: "My Neck, My Black, catch some passes, get a sack."

    Knowing that this team consists of 80% of the board, I hope their approval rating is higher than their ranking. But shoutout to Logan for, not only being a great director of players, but also for scoring the only point for his team this season. Let’s not make it your last.

    I don't know about you, but this team may win season 22” (Taylor Swift's Voice). You can see Dwaylan making sacks on the field and twerking at the bar. Not only a star in name, Connor Starr shined bright on the field while sporting a shoulder brace and finishing the game. From talent to determination, I wonder who’s going to beat this team.
