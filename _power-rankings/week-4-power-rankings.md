    The DCGFFT or Gold team had a weekend that was anything but 24k. With their first two losses its no shock to hear they needed a few Truly’s between games. Even so, they put up a great fight in both but came a little bit short of the mark. Give them a few days and maybe a few more truly and trust me they’ll be back to their gold standard.

    Chrome Wreckers love to ride bumper to bumper on the scoreboard. After a 20-19 win last week they found themselves with a 19-20 loss this week. With an athletic roster and experienced players fingers crossed they can turn things around. If they don’t learn how to create some distance the only thing getting wrecked will be their record.

    After watching Super Pwinks past games the only thing we are is super-ised that they were able to pull off a win this weekend. Plagued with injuries and absences, who could have predicted that interim captain Nikki would lead this team play after play to their first win. Inspired by her performance no doubt, Derrick Holt put on a show of his own with a game changing pick 6. Be warned. If they keep that energy and that bench clears up the Super Pwinks could give any team a run for their money.

    Although their captain was abroad Citrus Got Real showed up and showed out this week. Getting their first win against My Neck, My Black. Let’s see if they can do it again next week in their fruit filled bout with Orange queery.

    In a tough loss against last weeks #1 team, Peritwinkle did their best but ultimately came up short. Nevertheless, Twinkerbelle must have been sprinkling a little fairy dust on this team because Drew Crane was flying all over the field. Maybe next week the rest of the Lost Boys will grow up a little and put up enough numbers to beat the grown ups.

    Who wore it better: The Titanic or Boat’s N Hoes cause both these ships are sinking. With a third week of losses (admittedly against good teams), what do boats and hoes have in common? In this case they all seem to go down. Hopefully there's a life raft on board cause somebody needs saving.

    You is smart, you is kind, you is important. I don’t know what else to say to y’all at this point. Better luck next week.
