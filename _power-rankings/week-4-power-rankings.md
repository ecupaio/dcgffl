    In a tough loss against last weeks #1 team, Peritwinkle did their best but ultimately came up short. Nevertheless, Twinkerbelle must have been sprinkling a little fairy dust on this team because Drew Crane was flying all over the field. Maybe next week the rest of the Lost Boys will grow up a little and put up enough numbers to beat the grown ups.

    Who wore it better: The Titanic or Boat’s N Hoes cause both these ships are sinking. With a third week of losses (admittedly against good teams), what do boats and hoes have in common? In this case they all seem to go down. Hopefully there's a life raft on board cause somebody needs saving.

    You is smart, you is kind, you is important. I don’t know what else to say to y’all at this point. Better luck next week.
