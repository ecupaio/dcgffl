    DCGFFL sponsor, mom, and legend Margie Hofberg holding baby Lucas Owen Graham-Roll while new dad Scott made his return to the field said it all. This team can’t lose.

    The undefeated streak came to a close with a tough 48-18 loss to ugenta variant this week. Not sure if it was because they were missing the shine from Jean-Francois’s pom-poms or if it was because captain Bobby couldn’t see the field in those sunglasses and sun hat, but this team has finally seen the shade.

    sadly mistaken! This team might be under the radar, but like any good cocktail,
    it’ll sneak up on you and take you for a ride. And not the ride we know ya'll
    are looking for ;) \n\n![Latest Cocktail GIFs | Gfycat](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/SanePeskyGalapagoshawk-max-1mb.gif)"

    We hear the best way to prepare for game day is to get silly drunk at a wedding the night before. Maybe if Captain Japinga had fewer _Champagne Problems_ our Taylor’s would have done _All Too Well (Taylor’s Version. 10-Minutes duh)_.

    Big week for the girls in magenta, serving Buns of Steel their first loss of the season! We’re not sure what’s sicker, this team or DJ DJ’s beats at Kiki. Either way, we better get a vaccine soon because this team is coming for us all.

    This team doesn't seem to care too much about anything, but somehow they keep winning. No joke, we saw Keaton run over mid-game to the BBQ mixer happening next to the field to get a snack instead of a sack.

    Wunder Bred might have been missing from last week's power rankings, but they must not have minded cause they gave us the same energy this week as the last. Another tough week for Wonder Bred’s Rookie Captain and QB duo. Maybe it just takes a little more seasoning to get this team on track. I’d suggest checking your local Trader Hoe’s for some “Everything But The Bottle” seasoning because the way ya’ll party after an L is easily ranked #1 in my book.

    Consistency seems to be the goal for this team. There’s not much to say because the record speaks for itself. Instead let’s put a spotlight on how Queen Mother Munroe showed up to teach the girls how to turn a run away game into a runway moment for DCGFFL’s Spring Summer collection. Yeah, maybe the scoreboards not looking so great but rest assured the sideline does.
