  of all ages, the DCGFFL proudly brings to you it’s … WWE …. TAG TEAM CHAMPIO—-…I
  mean, wait a minute, sorry, got carried away there.  Howdy, it’s just your friendly
  old league curmudgeons, Gordo and Sean Bartel. Some people ask us why we’re writing
  this playoff preview, and we’re going to be honest with you: we entered a contest.
  We lost. (cue the references to Statler and Waldorf from the Muppets)  Congratulations
  to all teams - yes even you Navy Blue! - you’ve made it to the playoffs. Mostly
  all of your teams and bodies remain intact, which alone is quite a feat for this
  crew. Now it is up to us grumpy(ish) old white men to tell you how to live your
  lives—, nope, wait, again, watching too much TV here. We’re here to bring to you
  a DCGFFL Playoff Preview, wrapping up the season that was, throwing some very necessary
  shade, plunking in some antiquated (and maybe modern) pop culture references, and
  sharing our predictions for this upcoming weekend (and week after).   Quick shout
  out to Del for letting us have a go at this, even if we might have threatened him
  with making a documentary called “I Know What You Did Last End-of-Season Party.”
  (you’re a great sport, Del). Okay, okay, enough already (congrats Gordo and Sean
  for not posting a picture of their child or dog yet), let’s get down to brass tacks.'

    Woke: *Nice people

    For as awesome as this board has been this season (seriously, I’ve loved the care, transparency, and approachability of this group so much), they probably would have served teams better if they were more widely distributed. Either way, lots of DCGFFL’ers will be rooting for them for one of two reasons: shock the world, or lock in the worst record of all time so that the rest of us don’t have as much shame being on a winless team from seasons past (shout out to Blue-a Lipa from this past fall!). Football futility is never fun, but this league sure is, and we have the good sports, good sportspeople, and good athletes of this team to thank.

    Also let’s give it up for Kyle Butts, living simultaneously in nine different cities at one time. I would say he’s omnipresent, but I don’t know what that word means or if I’m using it correctly.

    Well folks, that does it from us. Remember, if anything above bothered you or upset you, it wasn’t written by me and was definitely from the other guy.

    Thanks again to all of you for making this community something truly special, and one of the highlights of our spring and fall, even more so now that we get to share it with my little Gordito (Gordo) and Freddie Mercury (Sean). Good luck, get off the bench, get in the game, have fun, be safe, and enjoy this upcoming weekend!
