author: Gordo and Sean - The Prime Directive prohibits Starfleet personnel and spacecraft
  from interfering in the normal development of any society, and mandates that any
  Starfleet vessel or crew member is expendable to prevent violation of this rule.[4]  and  As
  the right of each sentient species to live in accordance with its normal cultural
  evolution is considered sacred, no Starfleet personnel may interfere with the normal
  and healthy development of alien life and culture. Such interference includes introducing
  superior knowledge, strength, or technology to a world whose society is incapable
  of handling such advantages wisely. Starfleet personnel may not violate this Prime
  Directive, even to save their lives and/or their ship, unless they are acting to
  right an earlier violation or an accidental contamination of said culture. This
  directive takes precedence over any and all other considerations, and carries with
  it the highest moral obligation.
