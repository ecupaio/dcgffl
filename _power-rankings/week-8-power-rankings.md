  mean, wait a minute, sorry, got carried away there.  Howdy, it’s just your friendly
  old league curmudgeons, Gordo and Sean Bartel. Some people ask us why we’re writing
  this playoff preview, and we’re going to be honest with you: we entered a contest.
  We lost. (cue the references to Statler and Waldorf from the Muppets)  Congratulations
  to all teams - yes even you Navy Blue! - you’ve made it to the playoffs. Mostly
  all of your teams and bodies remain intact, which alone is quite a feat for this
  crew. Now it is up to us grumpy(ish) old white men to tell you how to live your
  lives—, nope, wait, again, watching too much TV here. We’re here to bring to you
  a DCGFFL Playoff Preview, wrapping up the season that was, throwing some very necessary
  shade, plunking in some antiquated (and maybe modern) pop culture references, and
  sharing our predictions for this upcoming weekend (and week after).   Quick shout
  out to Del for letting us have a go at this, even if we might have threatened him
  with making a documentary called “I Know What You Did Last End-of-Season Party.”
  (you’re a great sport, Del). Okay, okay, enough already (congrats Gordo and Sean
  for not posting a picture of their child or dog yet), let’s get down to brass tacks.'

    Oh, look! You made it past our long, boring intro! Sucker.

    It must be pretty cool to play for a team that features (1) the commissioner’s husband and (2) the son of the league’s most dedicated and passionate sponsor (we love you, Margie). And it must be pretty cool to referee their games, since they don’t get any penalties called on them. Okay, okay, in all seriousness, this has been the super-team everyone anticipated it would be after draft night. Even worse, they play well, show some strong camaraderie, AND make up new cheers for each game. I’d also like to commend the team on getting some serious contributions from FOGWAPS - no, that’s not GottMik’s long lost cousin, it’s the “Fraternity of Generals Who *Actually* Play Sundays” - add that to the league glossary alongside TAP, TDG, RFK, PEP, PrEP, BDSM, ABDL, and OMG my BFF Jill.

    Brandon W. has had quite a career in DCGFFL, and dedicated so much time and energy to this league (and intimidating referees…come on, I had to), so we’ll let him get away with playing the “good guy” in this narrative that we haven’t seen a gay QB take a team to championship glory since Season 7, and that he’s the rightful heir. We just hope it’s like a Jon Snow type thing and not a Khaleesi type thing…yikes.

    I cannot confirm or deny that Matan was cast as Eminem in the Israeli version of 8-mile, but I can tell you his pre-game mixtape features artists including Ofra Haza, Netta, Wu Tang, Neil Diamond, Billy Joel, and Adam Lambert. As for his teammates, Bobby’s and Ben’s draft strategy brought a bodacious brigade of ballers to bear a bounty of big wins.

    Speaking of draft, how about Joel Horton repping NGFFL and DCGFFL at this year’s NFL draft? It took a long time for us to finally see this big historic moment, but not nearly as long as it took for Ben Hunt to once and for all lead a team to the DCGFFL championship (Season XXI). I love a lot of people on this team (Tony Smith, my (Gordo’s) forever teammate, among many others), but they only go as far as the Hunt karma/durability allows. Perhaps he finally exorcized his demons during the pandemic with all those injuries and trips to PV. Or perhaps it only bought him one great season? IDK, but please save me a cookie? Those are bomb diggity (I’m hip!).

    Sean: I’m on Ben Hunt’s side - he watched my dog Freddie for a week. So I can’t say much bad about him.

    Gordo: Oh look at you, waiting two minutes before talking about your dog.

    Sean: Well he’s a cute little guy, although he’s failed at getting me a husband.

    Gordo: You’re blaming Freddie for that?

    Sean: I AM SO LONELY! *cries into his jersey*

    Gordo: Take it easy there, champ. Maybe take a few plays off.

    Sean: Yeah, I’m gonna go watch some Teletubbies and have an edible.

    A tip of the cap also goes to the veterans and Dads on this team for both steering the young impressionable athletes of this team (including everyone’s favorite thirsty ginger, Josh E.), and providing me (Gordo) with in-depth children’s tv show recommendations (Bluey FTW). Two big things at play this weekend will be Oriya’s durability, and Sean Karson and Fatima dueling it out for 'nicest person we wouldn't actually mind seeing win.'

    Oh, I thought we were supposed to cancel the season and hand JC and Cameron the trophy when this QB/Captain pairing was first announced. Billed as our next QB legend, Big C struggled to find his footing at first, looking more like The Great White Hype than anything else (now *there’s* an antiquated movie reference for you). With JC and others falling to injury, this team was left Castaway (better?) until Nikki (an overall league MVP candidate in my opinion)grabbed the leadership reins and really got this teams rears in gear.

    (Board Member note: MVP is determined by statistics.

    Gordo note: Statistics are dumb.)

    In the weeks that followed, QB1 started to show more trust in his receivers, no longer relying on what felt like maybe 2 targets. A shrewd supplemental pick in Sam Cramer shored up a lot of chemistry (and culinary) issues, and this team is looking red (or pink) hot heading into this weekend. Now THAT’S a good bake.

    Gordo: What exactly IS “Super” Pink?

    Sean: It’s pretty much when mid-game Sam Cramer begins twerking to “Get this party started”.

    a lackluster fall season, Ben McEvoy surrounded himself with an encouraging collection

    is that any path to success will involve all of these things, but hey, Captain

    You know, I wanted to drop some shade on Brandon M. for his reputation of saying/doing some unsavory/unsportsmany things on the field, but, his rookie captainship has really done a lot for this league, if only to enthusiastically provide shade on his own players, so good on him (just please don’t German suplex or chokeslam any rushers/lineman this weekend, okay?).

    Based on Brandon’s inside scoop, there seem to be a few variables at play that will determine Wonder’s playoff performance: can Obie hold steady, now that he’s lost his locks (and his strength, a la Samson)? We’ve seen Alex show up on the field, but will he ever show up at Kiki? Will it be 3” shorts weather for Andrew? Is Lamar going to be that super athlete this team needs, or will he get taken down by an eyelash in his eye?

    Going into the season, the scouting report on QB Jamil was “he’s really really fast, but IDK if he’s a good QB?” and as the season progressed, most critics are saying … “he’s really really fast, but IDK if he’s a good QB?” Daddy Andy can hopefully be a guiding force, if he’s not wobbling his way around the field (and after his kids). Fernando has also been quite a presence on the sideline, but what does that mean for the team? Will he play? Which version of Fernando is gonna play, if he’s cleared to do so? The 6-sacks-in-one-game one? Or is he looking ahead to be 100% for kickball season?

    Win or lose, though, Adam makes a great point: who doesn’t love a good twink?

    As for this team and season, the season started in a State of Grace, collecting 4 victories from the go. The weeks that followed felt like Everything Has Changed, ending things on a Sad Beautiful Tragic note. To quote another respected gunslinger from pop culture, Sam Neil (people GET the Big Lebowski, right?): “sometimes you eat the bar, and sometimes, the bar, well, he eats you.”

    How do they reverse their fortunes and Begin Again as the undefeated crew we saw early on? Lean on their leadership: Japinga can get this talent aligned, Hotchy has the moxy, and if Adam can help contribute to a little Strasmas miracle, we might find Red to be The Lucky One in the Final Four after all. My gut, however, says they’ll be the Girl at Home next weekend.

    Sean: I dunno … the great recession, the Kardashians, the death of the dinosaurs. Pretty much everything.

    Give it up to Sam Brown for captaining even while he can’t play. This season hasn’t gone the way he wanted, but there’s only so much we can lay on his shoulders … ok that’s a lie, we can blame him for everything.

    Going into the season, some said new QB Wilkes was a bit hard headed. Well, as someone who ran headfirst into it on our first offensive play a few weeks ago, I’m going to agree. Between that and Drew’s athleticism, distracting good looks, and audibly heavy breathing on the line of scrimmage, I’m surprised I didn’t leave that game with a new mancrush, concussion, or new COVID variant. We did leave with a sobering loss that day, though, so other teams beware.

    We agree, Bryan. But we’d also like to give you credit for not only beating Sean in the palest DCGFFL contest, but also getting a sunburn during last week’s thunder storm. And to be fair, Joe Heron drafted one helluva team, it just, well, isn’t adding up. One thing that did come through this season? A dancing queen.

    Does Pat have the skills to squeak out an opening match-up victory? Yes, but it takes more than just him. One lesson that remains as true as ever in this league: it’s the players and veterans that lift you up who truly make a difference, not the ones quick to criticize. That said, we can’t wait for the Joe/Pat/Aaron twerk-off at Kiki.

    There are not many people who “won” the pandemic years, but JC and his doomsday bod have to be up there. Some might call it a reinvention, but to be honest, the killer instinct and way of the sword have always been with JC, he just now shines that sword on his somehow perfectly tanned abs. (while Kevin Hamilton’s chiseled \[yet pasty\] abs, in stark contrast, blinded most opponents when he went “crop top” halfway through the season. Mmm, nothing like some pasty chiseled FOGWAPS).

    That’s why we’re scratching our heads when he assembled the team everyone wanted to have mixers with. (We’re so confused, we ended that last sentence with a preposition! Don’t tell my Mom, she’s an English teacher.) Everytime I watch this squad I see Sean Holihan and a band of twinks. Like, sheesh, this team looks like the back row of a Bar Mitzvah filled with random gentile blondies. I expect them to come off the field asking “When do we get that wine thing you drink that has all the sugar…”

    Speaking of charming blondes, we have to give our respect to rookie QB (and a rec team co-captain) Zach Brown, the human equivalent of a Ken doll. Thankfully, he’s significantly more mobile and athletic (and modest, already contributing so much to this league), but it was a rough go for the young gunslinger - a Twink-laden team didn’t do him many O-line favors, leaving little to no pass protection.

    Look, we’re doing everything we can to avoid the obvious _musician_ reference, but we’re considering this team to be Chicken Fried early on Sunday, and hey, Whatever It Is, we hope these players and their signal caller find more success in Colder Weather during the fall season. Still, we know on-field leaders like Amanda and sideline inspirers like Paddy Mac will make sure the team fights (or attempts to SLAYYYYYY) valiantly.

    For as awesome as this board has been this season (seriously, I’ve loved the care, transparency, and approachability of this group so much), they probably would have served teams better if they were more widely distributed. Either way, lots of DCGFFL’ers will be rooting for them for one of two reasons: shock the world, or lock in the worst record of all time so that the rest of us don’t have as much shame being on a winless team from seasons past (shout out to Blue-a Lipa from this past fall!). Football futility is never fun, but this league sure is, and we have the good sports, good sportspeople, and good athletes of this team to thank.

    Also let’s give it up for Kyle Butts, living simultaneously in nine different cities at one time. I would say he’s omnipresent, but I don’t know what that word means or if I’m using it correctly.

    Well folks, that does it from us. Remember, if anything above bothered you or upset you, it wasn’t written by me and was definitely from the other guy.

    Thanks again to all of you for making this community something truly special, and one of the highlights of our spring and fall, even more so now that we get to share it with my little Gordito (Gordo) and Freddie Mercury (Sean). Good luck, get off the bench, get in the game, have fun, be safe, and enjoy this upcoming weekend!
