  Anonymous Duo - Well, week one has come and gone. The luck of the Irish was
  with some, missing from others. New comers and league staples alike made some
  big plays. But boy, were our power ranking projections out of line for most
  matchups. Shout out to all of the refs in action and in training this week as
  our league worked to game 3, our first all Women’s+ crew! Also, thank you to
  all players for not sassing these refs.   As week three comes to the front,
  once again, may the odds ever be in your favor.

      The championship that never was. Lizzie proved to the entire league that
      had this game happened last season, Carolina Blue would’ve had a run for
      their money. Someone tell that team that those winning medals were given,
      not earned. Texas Orange is up and down this stat sheet with sacks, INT,
      and TDs. I have it on good authority that they were pretty mad about their
      4th place ranking last week and they were trying to prove a point to this
      anonymous duo. (BTW, we don’t take kindly to being mocked at Sunday Funday
      and I was outvoted on putting you at 6th on that alone). It is hard to
      poke holes in this team, though the fields at Carter Barron might do that
      for me. Let’s hope Lizzie \**cough\** Keely \*cough\* can keep the
      momentum going.

      We knew this team was going to be a force to be reckoned with, however, we
      were not expecting to be at this level. I would like to think that my
      callout last week of the showdown of the Denver QBs led to this strong
      week one performance, but to be honest I think it can be chalked up to
      Lynch having the hair out of her face. Despite the high score, Lynch,
      Christine H., and Meg B. hold the only stats for the team. Oldest people
      in the league carrying the best team on their back. Just please don’t
      break it. Our team sizes can’t handle any injuries. Slightly impressive
      that Lynch has weapons like Shayne and didn’t even need to use her. This
      team is going to be hard to beat when they’re on.

      SappicFire: This 80 for Brady captain/QB duo came out hot against Red-y or
      Not. Red had no idea if Kori or Sarah was going to be receiving the snap,
      as this team setup consistently in a wild cat offense. Some believe that a
      professional offensive coordinator was hired for week 2, but Kori is
      claiming it is all self designed. Overall, I was impressed by this team
      and their rookies performed outstandingly across the board. I hear this
      week a new play will be added to the routine incorporating a few
      gymnastics moves and a giant slingshot. Overall Sapphicfire put on a show.
      Thank goodness they still have the earlier game time this week to not
      interfere with bingo at the community center.

      Fan favorite team name Bluebies gave the DCGFFL a chaotic show on Sunday.
      One would say they did not perform as well as anticipated with receivers
      confused and wearing frying pans for gloves and defense forgetting to
      cover Christine. New QB Jamiee and captain Em kept their cool in the chaos
      and started to look more organized by the end of the game, but gold had
      already taken control. This writer is hopeful Navy’s status will rise once
      they get another game under their belt and add some additional talent
      during the supplemental draft to replace some ghosts…

      Red-y or Not: Red was almost ready for kickoff with 7 players at kickoff.
      Thankfully Em Lefler showed up 5 minutes in and supported the team on
      offense and defense with both a TD and INT. Red was also not ready for the
      chaos caused by Sapphicfire’s AP level offensive coordination. May I
      recommend reviewing the film for the next matchup? The low player counts
      had everyone playing both sides of the ball, causing QB1 Mere to chase
      down Kori, with the highest level of athleticism, embraced their inner
      Josh Allen, and laid out for the flag pull on an INT. While this was
      exciting, and prevented a TD in that moment, the play, took Mere out of
      the game due to age related injury. Overall, the passion and skill are
      there, if this team can get everyone to the field ontime, I would not
      discount them.

      Let’s just say that no one on this team was eating green beans for Sunday
      Dinner. The final team making us eat our words, Green Beans. There is not
      a lot to say about this game this week. The defenders on this team caught
      better than their receivers. This game proves that there is a lot to be
      said about team chemistry as it looks like this team has 0 of it. At least
      the babies were cute.But readers, don’t mistake my criticism for a lack of
      faith. We saw a lot of good on the field on Sunday from the Green team and
      once they get that chemistry down, they can easily crack the top 3.
