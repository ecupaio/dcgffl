  Week Two is done and dusted! With the butterflies and nerves of the opener out
  of the way, we got to see what each team is truly made of. Wind and weather
  were none too kind to the QBs this week but that didn’t stop a ton of points
  from getting scored Friday night!

      No Meg? No Problem. The Barracooters won again this week, 27-18 against
      Lime Green, and this game truly had a little bit of everything.. With Meg
      Lukacs out, the Barracooters started Camille Thompson as QB this week, and
      she stepped up for them big time. With two TDs on the ground and one
      through the air, Camille did her best Lamar Jackson impression and helped
      steer Carolina Blue to victory.&nbsp;


      Munroe Bell-Rose ran a kickoff back for a touchdown faster than Beyonce’s
      tour selling out. Marla Woodarek took over the final drive of the game
      with three sacks and a safety. Captain Nik Battaglia finally showed up
      after missing last Friday due to mourning the loss of Aaron Rodgers
      COVID-19 and likely recorded the first crotch-blocked-punt in DCGFFL
      history. Again, a little bit of everything in this one, whether you wanted
      it or not.&nbsp;


      Carolina Blue’s defense struggled with Lime Green at times, but slammed
      the door shut when it mattered most. A nice blend of savvy veterans and
      new talent have the Barracooters at the top of the rankings heading into a
      Week Three showdown with the Weird Barbies.

      Turkey bacon no longer! We got full-flavored, cholesterol-raising bacon
      from Forest Green this week as they left no doubt in their 33-6
      dismantling of Weird Barbies. Game MVP Taylor recorded a receiving
      touchdown and three interceptions, including one returned for a score. QB
      Lizzie B threw four touchdowns and scored a two-point conversion. Green
      Eggs Gone Ham flexed their defensive muscles with SEVEN total
      interceptions this week in a game that was full of them. Captain Sam Cline
      must be feeling pretty proud of her squad this week, and grateful to stave
      off Nikki benching everyone - at least for another week. They play Lime
      Green next week.

      Friday was a tough one for our plasticky friends, the Weird Barbies.
      Picked off by Green Eggs Gone Ham seven times, this game was messier than
      the bathrooms at the Season 25 Anniversary Party. Credit to Pink’s
      defense, they forced five turnovers of their own and savvy veteran Rachel
      Browning ran one back for a score. While we don’t expect Weird Barbies to
      turn it over this much going forward, right now Neon Pink is giving a lot
      more Existential Crisis than Malibu Dream House.

      Despite being 0-2, Lime Green had a much juicier performance this week.
      League curmudgeon Lindsey and developing rock star Aubrey gave the
      Carolina Blue defense trouble all game as they both found the endzone. QB
      Mere Bell had zero hesitation in airing it out or running it in for a
      score, and treated us all to a very primal Xena, Warrior Princess scream
      afterwards.

      With tough defenders, an experienced quarterback and good athletes, these
      Squirters are a lot juicier than their sour record indicates. I expect
      them to turn it around soon.&nbsp;
