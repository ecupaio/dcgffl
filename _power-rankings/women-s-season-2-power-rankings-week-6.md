  By Tiara “T” Cypress - Wow, it’s the last game of the regular season, my how
  time flies. Who am I kidding, this has been the longest, 7, 8 or 9 weeks I’ve
  experienced in a long time. This week teams ensured their roster was fully
  present to show up and hopefully showout. Let’s rank some teams!
season: 25
week: 8

      Mariam returned for another game, albeit late (or just in time) and good
      thing she did. Miriam caught 3 catches in a row, and didn’t drop a pass,
      except that one! Miriam may also have a future as a rusher, applying
      pressure and racking up sacks - even if the refs didn’t call it. Desiree
      and Taylor did what they do best on defense and offense, breaking up
      passes, catching the ball between multiple defenders, catching passes over
      people shorter than them and even catching the ball with one foot out of
      bounds. Captain Sam recovered from her injury and returned to block. The
      week off may have done some good. Sam held off Lime’s rushers, released
      when QB Lizzie needed options, and even ran the ball in for a TD with the
      help of an extra long arm extension...according to her husband Matt…the
      referee… Erin returned at center and was a consistent checkdown. Although
      Forest has proven pretty consistent, if they take the week to polish their
      offense and defense, they’ll be unstoppable during playoffs.

      Last week, I thought Blue was showing signs of losing steam, but after
      further evaluation, I have concluded that they are just complacent as top
      seed. I mean, they’re winning but not giving us their best. Tonight we got
      to see what happens when you mix Meg + High Noons = False Starts. Marla,
      who typically leads the team in sacks, left Pink’s QB unscathed, but she
      caught a pass so – yay? Nik forgot who her teammate was and ended up
      swatting a pass for Camille. Also on the non-receiving end was
      Stacy…perhaps it was jet lag or playing defense too long. How do you say
      “I left my hands at home" in Japanese? Heck, even the adjacent soccer game
      didn't want it for them, as a rogue ball stopped QB Meg from unleashing
      her inner Lamar Jackson… or Daniel Jones… or Eli Manning?


      Maybe the Cooters are reserving their best for playoffs, I guess we’ll
      find out on the field next week.

      Deja vu much? Yet again, lime green goes up against a top seeded team and
      almost pulls out a win, but in the words of Brandy “Almost doesn’t count”.
      It may have been a different game if Lime was able to hold on to
      interceptions. Don’t let Em’s and Linda’s Spongebob arms fool yah, they
      were jamming at the line and forest green couldn’t handle it. Per usual,
      Lindsey brought her hands and had 2 picks and a touchdown. What she
      managed to forget was her uniform. I don’t know if she is over lime green
      or just didn’t do laundry. Maybe next week, Squirters should consider
      changing their name to Limearitas. It seemed to work for Elle. When you
      give her one margarita, she scores a touchdown. Imagine if yall had given
      her two…

      The Barbies called in reinforcements this week…but somehow having more
      people did not translate into having more touchdowns. I guess there isn’t
      power in numbers. Since the roster was heavy, some players had the chance
      to support in other roles. You can usually find Bre rushing at someone’s
      kneecaps, but tonight she was a receiver. The only thing she did not
      receive was a touchdown. She went from pulling flags to flag guarding. The
      refs should have taken pity on them and just given them the TD. Too bad
      Rachel is on IR because they could have used her defensive prowess.
      *Googles* “how to heal a dislocated shoulder in 6 days”. And Mecha played
      too, I think. Well, good thing they had Alley to hold off the pressure
      coming from Blue. Maybe during next week’s playoff they’ll rip off the
      plastic and act brand new!!
