  Anonymous Duo - Hello DCGFFL! We are excited to start another season of the
  Women’s+ Division! Our league is multiplying by 1.5 and we have moved to a
  friendlier time slot for our over 30 crowd. Although the Open Division gave us
  less than fashionable colors to pick from, we are excited to see fresh faces
  and new teams storm Carter Barron every week, along with a plethora of small
  human cheerleaders and their white claw/wine consuming guardians on the side
  lines. Let’s get going with these preseason rankings; May the odds be ever in
  your favor:
season: 26
week: 0
rankings:

    record: Jaimee S. / Emily B.

      Move over Lynch, we have a new Denver QB in the DCGFFL and she’s ready to
      make a name for herself. Paired with Em, who may finally be on a team with
      a winning record, this duo may be the first real team coming for Meg’s
      title. With a good mix of vets and rookies, this team looks primed to have
      a strong first game. If they do come up short, all is not lost, at least
      Em isn’t on a lime green team.

    record: Kristin Lynch / Shayne Madella

      New captain Shayne and returning QB Lynch have a lot to be excited about
      this season with a roster packed with veteran talent. With the least
      amount of rookies on the roster, Captain Shayne doesn’t have to spend a
      lot of time teaching. Her time would be better spent convincing her team
      to play defense. This team is also most likely to have the best
      inspirational speeches by a QB.
  - team: _teams/s03-women-s-kelly-green.md
    record: Megan Lukacs / Amy Smith

      In a surprising turn, the returning champion Meg is coming in as 3rd seed.
      To be fair, new captain Amy and returning QB Meg were probably having a
      hard time remembering who were vets and who were rookies. Other teams
      shouldn’t get comfortable though because these authors have no doubt that
      Meg and Amy will quickly start climbing the ranks.
  - team: _teams/s03-women-s-texas-orange.md
    record: Lizzie Becker / Lex Pfearsen & Camille Thompson
    text: >-
      New Captain Lex and Returning QB Lizzie have the veteran knowledge of
      recently turned bionic Camille. Hoping that Camille’s talents on the field
      are equal to her leadership off, this team should have no issues with
      claiming some victories. This team has plenty of veteran knowledge to
      spread with their starting lineup, especially in the defense
      department.Texas Orange will need to giddy up and start grooming for their
      playoff run earlier, as their QB is moonlighting as a marathon runner
      during championship weekend.
  - team: _teams/s02-women-s-red.md
    record: Meredith Morgan / Judy H.
    text: >-
      New Captain Judy and Veteran QB Mere look to take the league by storm
      early, as their team is full of potential surprises with a plethora of
      brand new names and talents. While Judy was present, and Mere was able to
      FaceTime on Sudafed into the draft, they were MIA during TAP, leaving new
      players confused with many drink tickets and no direction. Rumor has it
      Judy was recruiting new talent in PR, just working on registering them for
      supplemental.
  - team: _teams/s03-women-s-sapphire.md
    record: Kori S. / Steph McDaniel
    text: >-
      &nbsp;Returning Captain Steph and Veteran Player, new QB Kori are in
      charge here. Now this team is run by some oldies, but goodies. Combined
      involvement in NGFFL around 73 years. New to the QB circuit, Kori is
      looking to focus on developing their style, as well as playing in a
      position known for fewer injuries. This team is chock full of receivers,
      so hopefully there will be some fabulous plays coming down the pipeline.
      Steph will have a lot of coaching with the defense, getting some receivers
      to play 2-3-2 and not run routes. We will get back to you after Kori
      reviews this weekend’s film.
