    and Cameron Burrell inject into themselves? I have questions. Kozak’s Response:
    Whatever Gold is doing is working this season. Last undefeated team left in the
    league. Can they match Tie Dye Blue from Season IV?'

    Welcome to mortality Captain Stern. Kozak’s Response: Pink pushed deep down the
    field, but couldn’t seal the deal against Dark Green to lose their first game
    of the season. Rough way to pop your losing cherry.'

  power_ranking_4_comments: ": Kozak’s Take: Big game for the bday boy Nolan Lazarus,
    proving that he isn’t past his prime, no matter what the rest of the league says.
    DMitch’s Response: Leave him alone…he’s only 12. If that’s past his prime, then
    you need to be fossilized my dear Kozak."

  power_ranking_6_comments: 'Kozak’s Take: Red was certainly under-manned on Sunday
    (only 7 players) and still almost pulled off the W. The league may be screwed
    if they ever get fully healthy. DMitch’s Response: I think they have some of what
    Gold is taking. Commissioner Kenderdine better start implementing drug tests.'

    (D-R-A-G), because 2 lettered acts (Q-B) aren’t your thing. Kozak’s Response:
    Leave Z alone! Considering they had no QB and 24 hours’ notice to field a team,
    I think that drag team did enough to <img class="alignnone" src="https://mvchaeljames.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/tumblr_lyzb3eij5g1qlvwnco1_400.gif"

    third ever winning record. Maybe he really has re-branded himself as a winner
