    Sunday. Good thing he had hernia surgery this week. DMitch’s Take: I mean, how
    much weight did he really carry against Black?'

    the addition of Billy Kramer and Amanda Livingstone. Welcome back you two! Kozak’s
    Response: You know your team is old when Billy Kramer is considered young.'

  power_ranking_2_comments: 'Will Bryant Burnheimer finally win a Super Bowl in her
    swan song? Or will Teal drop the ball, like Bryant does at least once a game?
    DMitch’s Response: That’s the game plan. She always makes up for her drops with
    a pretty TD catch though.'

  power_ranking_3_comments: 'DMitch’s Take: Rookie Colt Street made a pretty impressive
    start as backup QB, but there was something about Captain Alonzo Mable plus the
    merry twink combo of Austin Plier and Max Rothschild that he couldn’t shake off.
    Kozak’s Response: 3-0 with Rob Wildeman, 0-1 without him. Just saying…'

  power_ranking_4_comments: 'Kozak’s Take: I have been watching People vs OJ…Marcia
    Clark couldn’t do it alone 20 years ago. Marcia Hofberg can’t do it alone today.
    Get her some help (or at least bring back Hofberg’s perm). DMitch’s Response:
    Marcia said lemme put this makeup on and watch me werk in the 2nd half. Good thing
    she did because the rest of Team Sorority went to get their nails done.'

  power_ranking_5_comments: 'DMitch’s Take: QB Bryan Sanders said that he’s had better
    wood than what was in the Forest. But I ain’t the one to gossip…so you ain’t heard
    that from me. Kozak’s Response: Reading Bryan Sanders for being homo-suggestive
    is easier than beating the Black team on Sundays.'

  power_ranking_6_comments: 'Kozak’s Take: Yaawwwwwn. Wake me when you mercy rule
    a team. 32 point wins aren’t that impressive this season. DMitch’s Response: Captain
    Jamar Walker said “My hands work even when my knee doesn’t.” Maybe Maroon should
    have heeded that warning.'

    more graphite content than her opponents, and showed them Who Runs the World.
    Kozak’s Response: Neyonce Got Graphite Bodied and put their Love on Top. Maybe
    Matt Pearce is Irreplaceable?'

  power_ranking_8_comments: 'Kozak’s Take: While Josh Ellis was complaining about
    last week’s Power Rankings, he probably should have been figuring out how to cover
    Purple’s D-1 athletes… DMitch’s Response: Or at least figure out how not to come
    out of the game with half your team wounded.'

  power_ranking_9_comments: 'DMitch’s Take: Forest couldn’t get their wood up for
    the early morning Navy Boatie Call. Will some Viagra help Captain Howard Yuan
    and QB Matt Cline in their cause? Kozak’s Response: Who could get it up for Adam
    Strasberg anyways??'

  power_ranking_10_comments: 'Kozak’s Take: How does Purple beat a 2-0 Kelly Green
    team with everyone, then lose to a short-handed 0-3 Maroon team??? DMitch’s Response:
    To be fair, both teams were short-handed. Kelly’s Lipstick Ladies just gave it
    up…while Maroon’s Butches put a fight against the D-1 athletes.'

  power_ranking_11_comments: 'DMitch’s Take: Sand only won because Captain MopTop
    was the tallest player on the field, making it impossible for QB Long Diep to
    overthrow him. Kozak’s Response: Andy Allen has more wins this season than his
    last 3 seasons combined. Congratulations, Mr. Allen!!'

    captaining Matt Nix, but you need 7 players to play football. Best wishes. DMitch’s
    Response: Shouldn’t one of the players be the captain?'

    the Dirty Martini after the party was too much for her. Kozak’s Response: Alicia
    and the Silverstones finally busted their cherry!!! <img class="alignnone" src="http://s1.r29static.com//bin/entry/dae/x/1447473/image.gif"

  power_ranking_14_comments: 'Kozak’s Take: Captain Chris Morse has started the last
    two seasons 3-1 and didn’t win either Super Bowl. He is 1-3 now and he will not
    reverse that trend this season. DMitch’s Response: Maroona Matata means no mercy.
    Is that to mean from the other team to them?'

    seen John Clemons written on a score card since….ever. Was he there? Did he play?
    I have questions… Kozak’s Response: Oh, Mr. Clemons was there and got burnt by
    known speedster Long Diep. I seent it.'

  power_ranking_16_comments: 'Kozak’s Take: I don’t see any dragons flying in to help
    the Targary-RED’s conquer this season. DMitch’s Response: Well, the only similarity
    Porter Brockway shares with Daenarys Stormborn is the blonde hair….unless you
    count Ken Green’s fiery mouth/attitude as a dragon-like attribute.'

  power_ranking_17_comments: 'DMitch’s Take: A wise person once told me that Gold
    will only participate in games where one of the teams doesn’t score. I’m starting
    to believe that philosophy. Kozak’s Response: Watch out Royal Blue. After these
    Girls get shut out, they take it out on their next opponent.'

    of 3 TDs per game. I would read you, but it appears life already has. DMitch’s
    Response: Seems like the last winning Orange team was….well never mind that. #TQ'

    of teams. Well, maybe just the worst of teams. Is the best yet to come? Kozak’s
    Response: What was uglier, Scott Graham’s hungover hobo chic outfit on the sidelines
    or Black’s play on the field?'
