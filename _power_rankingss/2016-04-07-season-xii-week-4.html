  power_ranking_0_comments: 'Kozak’s Take: Another week, another big win.  It is getting
    boring Tyler Fox and Mike D’Ignazio.  Time to shake it up.  DMitch’s Response:  This
    team is for real.  Who will be the first to take them out?  '

  power_ranking_1_comments: 'DMitch’s Take: I think Brandon Waggoner decided to make
    this game his FNL game…he tried to do everything possible to lose it.  Kozak’s
    Response: Don’t worry, Brandon will have his meltdown game sooner rather than
    later.  '

  power_ranking_2_comments: 'Kozak’s Take: Teal’s record looks great, but three of
    their four wins have been by a combined 10 points.  Are they playing down to their
    competition?  DMitch’s Response:  Teal just likes to keep the games competitive….or
    give their captain a small heart attack every Sunday.'

  power_ranking_3_comments: 'DMitch’s Take: Navy sailed along to 2 easy victories
    on Sunday.  Is the “straight” coalition of Strasberg and Sanders really a thing?  Kozak’s
    Response: Watch out DCGFFL, Navy has the highest scoring offense and the stingiest
    defense.  Sounds like they are for real.'

  power_ranking_4_comments: 'Kozak’s Take: Did Sam Smallwood have more fun beating
    Matt Pearce or celebrating after the game??  DMitch’s Response:  That win was
    so epic, even Marvin Washington had to join in the celebratory shots.'

  power_ranking_5_comments: 'DMitch’s Take: Matt Pearce is back and Graphite still
    loses?  Does this mean they’ve been downgraded to PG-13?  Kozak’s Response: Only
    14 points Matt Pearce?  I thought you normally put up at least twice that.  Maybe
    you should have retired after two Super Bowls like Elway.'

  power_ranking_6_comments: 'Kozak’s Take: Joe Green ran back the opening kick for
    a TD and the team did not look back for the rest of the game.  DMitch’s Response:  Is
    Will Lipovsky’s D-1 athletic plan finally starting to work?  Let’s see down the
    stretch.'

  power_ranking_7_comments: 'DMitch’s Take: President Womack don’t leave your team
    again!  Team Sorority couldn’t conduct a rush without you.  Kozak’s Response:
    Is Mark Hofberg turning into the new Brandon Waggoner?  A much, much, much younger
    Brandon Waggoner.'

    on his hands?  1 win with Earl Armstrong and 1 win with George Garner...  DMitch''s
    Response: RGIII vs. Kirk Cousins Part 2?  Same color, same controversy.'

  power_ranking_9_comments: " DMitch’s Take: Brandon Benjamin caught 4 TDs this weekend.
    \ He must have taken advantage of an Amazon Prime sale on hands this past weekend.
    \ Kozak’s Take: BB tell Donald that promo code you used on hands.  He lost his
    last week."

  power_ranking_10_comments: 'Kozak’s Take: Jeremy Steslicki, aren’t you supposed
    to be crippled?  What are you doing out there getting sacks??  DMitch’s Response:  I
    think he and Jamar Walker are using the same illegal substances in their recovery
    smoothies.'

  power_ranking_11_comments: 'DMitch’s Take: Sheerod, see what happens when you don’t
    take 8 sacks a half?  You score points!  Kozak’s Response: Is Sheerod’s game back?  I
    was about to put out an Amber Alert for her QB skills.'

  power_ranking_12_comments: 'Kozak’s Take: Backup QB Alex Payne kept them in the
    game on Sunday.  Can he do it two weeks in a row?  DMitch’s Response:  Perhaps.  Maybe
    someone besides Howard Yuan will catch a TD this time.'

  power_ranking_13_comments: 'DMitch’s Take: Ummm…4 picks and you still lose the game?  #QTNA  Kozak’s
    Response: I guess everyone was wrong.  Defense does not win games…or maybe just
    this defense.'

  power_ranking_14_comments: 'Kozak’s Take: First, Braden Boyd gets hurt.  Then Josh
    Ellis gets hurt.  Greg Carter, you in danger girl.  DMitch’s Response:  Before
    long, Javier de Diego will be their #1 receiver, and center, and rusher, and QB.'

  power_ranking_17_comments: " DMitch’s Take: 2 games where Gold scored points in
    the game.  Improvements abound!  Kozak’s Response: I am more worried about that
    defense than the O.  Other than their big win against Orange, they are allowing
    over 36 points per game."

    in both halves…there’s a start.'
