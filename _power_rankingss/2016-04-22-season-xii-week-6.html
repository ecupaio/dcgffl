    Smiffy actually push his team into the championship this time?  Kozak’s Response:
    Smiffy has a trophy boo.  It is Brandon who is ring-less.'

  power_ranking_1_comments: 'Kozak’s Take: Big game next week in the battle of the
    blues, versus Royal.  Navy needs the win to maintain the #2 seed in the playoffs.  DMitch’s
    Response:  Jim (who has QB’d in the league since 1948) vs. Bryan (who is 12 years
    old and started QB’n yesterday).  Who will prove victorious?'

  power_ranking_2_comments: 'DMitch’s Take: You know you’re winning when Sean Stern
    is in at QB…and this wasn’t a Peyton Manning/Brock Osweiler situation.  Kozak’s
    Response: That is so rude DMitch.  Matt Pearce is not nearly as washed up at Peyton
    was last season.'

  power_ranking_3_comments: 'Kozak’s Take: Bill Cammas is older than ever.  Let’s
    hope his body doesn’t break down in his old age like Tony Romo.  DMitch’s Response:
    Bill is older than Romo, and less hurt than him.  #youtriedit'

  power_ranking_4_comments: 'DMitch’s Take: We kinda figured that no Tyler Fox, no
    Will Jackson, or no Rudy L-B equaled no win for Neon Yellow.  What we also figured
    was that Captain Diggy and his merry band of speedy boys would make an appearance
    after halftime.  Kozak’s Response: The renaissance of Brian Hotchkiss came to
    a screeching halt once he starting taking snaps as QB.'

  power_ranking_5_comments: 'Kozak’s Take: Royal Blue is the Rodney Dangerfield of
    the DCGFFL…no respect.  Teams need to stop sleeping on this squad.  DMitch’s Response:
    OJ has caught more touchdowns than some QBs have thrown all season.  They must
    be doing something right there.'

    into her team, but it’s working.  Mecha, maybe you should share it with some captains
    ☺.  Kozak’s Response: DMitch, are you saying you want Mecha’s hot beef injection?'

  power_ranking_7_comments: 'Kozak’s Take: Way to kick Neon Yellow when they were
    down.  DMitch’s Reponse:  Neon Yellow has been winning by like 1100 PPG.  They
    say what’s good for the gander, is good for the goose….or something like that.  '

    Rico play…and a pick 6 in the waning moments of the game.  Kozak’s Response:  I
    saw Marlon Davis playing QB on Sunday.  I have two words of advice: please stop.'

  power_ranking_10_comments: 'DMitch’s Take: Can Captain Kozak get his team to his
    first winning season since Fall 2014?  Or will her argyles fall right before the
    finish line?  Kozak’s Response: I remember when I only had winning seasons…those
    were the days…'

  power_ranking_12_comments: 'DMitch’s Take: I can’t figure this team out…you beat
    Graphite and Purple, but lose to Sand?  Well, at least Cipullo played both halves
    this week.  Kozak’s Response: I figured them out…whenever Josh Richards wins MVP,
    they lose.  Mystery solved.'

    another game this season.  Way to prove me wrong.  And I still don’t think you
    will win another game.  DMitch’s Response:  Never say never…they play Kelly Green
    next week.'

  power_ranking_14_comments: 'DMitch’s Take: I believe this team is lost in the same
    jungle as Bagheera, Mowgli, and Baloo, because they sure aren’t showing up on
    the football field.  Kozak’s Response: Is Barry the Baloo in this scenario?  Who
    would have thought such a fun, talented team would be so boring and bad?'

    also die on the fields like the Starks every Sunday as well.'

    their first win!!  Somewhere, a Cleveland Browns fan (named Patrick) is weeping
    softly.  Kozak’s Response: I root for my TouchBrowns’ successes on and off the
    field.  Not sure how many more on-field successes these two will have this season
    ☺.'

    say anything nice, sit next to her.  She would have a field day with this 5 game
    losing streak.  DMitch’s Take:  A team full of Kelly Bundys would fare on the
    field better than this team.'

  power_ranking_18_comments: 'DMitch’s Take: There’s a lot of talent on this team…why
    can’t they let their powers unite to summon Captain Victory?  Kozak’s Response:
    I appreciate a Captain Planet reference on Earth Day as much as the next guy,
    but these Planeteers need a hero.'

    Rankings Gold.  Last time you were here, you shut out Orange.  Watch out White!  DMitch’s
    Response:  Hey Now, Gold is about to have a Change of Heart, and stick it to White!  That’s
    what I think. '
