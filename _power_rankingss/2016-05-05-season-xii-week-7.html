  power_ranking_0_comments: 'Kozak’s Take: Welcome to the top of the DCGFFL Bryan
    Sanders.  Seeing your lineup for Sunday, your reign of terror won’t last long.  DMitch’s
    Response:  Do we expect Team Sorority to actually show up, even if they are on
    the field?'

  power_ranking_1_comments: 'DMitch’s Take: I think Neon Yellow is still putting up
    points on Graphite four days later.  Kozak’s Response: Tyler Fox won a Super Bowl
    his first DCGFFL season.  Will he win it again during his last season??'

  power_ranking_2_comments: 'Kozak’s Take: Is this Commissioner Greg Kenderdine’s
    first legitimate chance at winning a Super Bowl?  He has played a lot of seasons
    to not hoist the trophy yet.  DMitch’s Response:  He does have a couple of Super
    Bowl champions leading the charge.  It’s very possible.'

  power_ranking_3_comments: 'DMitch’s Take: Brandon Waggoner may be into same-gender
    loving, but he couldn’t handle the D put on him on Sunday.  Kozak’s Response:
    The less we talk about Brandon Waggoner’s sex life, the better.  We want people
    to read the Power Rankings, not vomit.'

  power_ranking_4_comments: 'Kozak’s Take: Matt Pearce’s team is only 5th in points
    per game?  I guess he gave up after winning a Super Bowl the same season as the
    Broncos.  DMitch’s Response: Well, they’d probably be higher if his team wasn’t
    2nd in drops.'

    female captain to pull out a winning season.  Congratulations!!  Kozak’s Response:
    Eat that Nikki Kasparek!'

  power_ranking_6_comments: 'Kozak’s Take: With Purple’s luck with playing backup
    QBs this season, Matt Pearce is definitely missing their game against Graphite
    Sunday.  DMitch’s Response:  Hopefully, their backup QB won’t be Sean Stern.  If
    so, *adds another L to the Graphite record*'

  power_ranking_7_comments: 'DMitch’s Take: 4 picks??  Did Jim Connolly forget which
    shade of blue he played for?  Kozak’s Response: To Jim’s credit, there were more
    Navy players than Royal on the field.  I am sure Jim wouldn’t have thrown 390485
    interceptions if he had 7 players at the game.'

  power_ranking_9_comments: 'DMitch’s Take: Kozak, I told you Sand would win again
    #youtriedit.  Now can they take home a winning season??  Kozak’s Response: Alright,
    alright.  I know nothing.  They play a winnable game on Sunday, so I predict a
    W (which means they will surely lose).'

  power_ranking_10_comments: 'Kozak’s Take: Defensive maestro Dan Cipullo almost pulled
    off the short-handed win on Sunday.  Maybe they can have enough to field a team
    and pull off the win this week.  DMitch’s Response:  They have a very winnable
    game against Black…maybe Neyonce’s namesake will inspire them to get in formation
    for the W.'

    you are needed for surgery to Maroon’s season.  Earline Armstrong, you are needed
    for surgery *gets off loudspeaker.*  Kozak’s Response: Maroon needs Earl Armstrong
    on the field period.'

  power_ranking_12_comments: 'Kozak’s Take: One injury can topple a team.  Can Power
    Blue get back on its feet Sunday or have they fallen and can’t get up?  DMitch’s
    Response:  Hopefully, that commercial is not Marlon Davis’ Lifetime movie.'

    having Scott Graham play in football games actually makes a difference??  I thought
    he was washed up.'

  power_ranking_15_comments: 'DMitch’s Take: Are the Mangerines ripening at the perfect
    time before playoffs?  2 wins in a row has them walking on sunshine.  Kozak’s
    Response: Check your facts DMitch.  2 wins out of the last 3 games.  Let’s not
    crown them the next DCGFFL Cinderella story just yet.'

    de Mayo and margaritas will reinvigorate Barry Mauck’s game and help them win
