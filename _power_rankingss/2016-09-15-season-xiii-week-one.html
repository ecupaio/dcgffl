    Blaney and Tom Loughran. Can’t wait to see how far you guys will fall in the Power
    Rankings the next few weeks!\r\n\r\nDMitch’s Response: We’ve seen this storyline
    before. 54 points scored in the first game, then 54 points scored against them
    in the next."

    like the creepy neighbor passes around popsicles on Family Guy. Funny…they favor
    each other in looks as well.\r\n\r\nKozak’s Response: Welcome back to the DCGFFL
    Patrick McIntyre. Please continue to complain about the tardiness of the Power
    Rankings on my Facebook timeline."

  power_ranking_2_comments: "Kozak’s Take: Should these 2 wins come with an asterisk
    since Jordan Anderson was not supposed to be on the fields Week 1?\r\n\r\nDMitch’s
    Response:   That seems to be the mantra on the draft board this season.  Will
    Commissioner Goodell, I mean Kenderdine comment on these shenanigans?"

    night on the blackjack tables, because they didn’t wake up until the 2<sup>nd</sup>\r\n\r\nKozak’s
    Response: If this team can win with “QB” Sean Holihan at the helm, imagine what
    they could do with Miles Patrie."

    winning QB is coming off the bench for Forest Green…\r\n\r\nDMitch’s Take:  Another
    suspectuous act…Shade must be the theme of Season The Thirteenth."

  power_ranking_5_comments: "DMitch’s Take: Team Sorority did just enough not to lose,
    despite QB Earl Armstrong losing his flags and shorts from Red’s rusher being
    up in his arse.\r\n\r\nKozak’s Response: Everyone should be very glad (or very
    disappointed) that it is not FUNderwear week if Earl’s ass was putting on a show."

    If he was muzzled, would his teams play as well?\r\n\r\nDMitch’s Response:  They
    would be a lot more quiet…I can guarantee you that one."

    with points galore in this game.  How will Purple perform when he’s not there?\r\n\r\nKozak’s
    Response: Eggplant is going to get roasted any week Hofberg is not there."

  power_ranking_8_comments: "The AJ Reust era begins with an OT win over a very good
    QB.  Not a bad way to start the season.\r\n\r\nDMitch’s Response:  AJ has a chip
    on his shoulder to prove.  Started out the right way against one of the league’s
    better teams."

  power_ranking_9_comments: "DMitch’s Take: Did Captain JW forget to tell his team
    that they were playing two games instead of one on Sunday?\r\n\r\nKozak’s Response:
    Scott Graham has 1 good ankle instead of 2. JW has 1 good knee instead of 2. 
    Kyle McKinney has 1 good hand instead of 2.  It makes sense this team played 1
    good game instead of 2."

  power_ranking_10_comments: "Kozak’s Take: Going into the season, we didn’t know
    if Beach Bowl QB Greg Kenderdine or DCGFFL  QB Greg Kenderdine would show up for
    Season 13.  After week  1, we have seen both.\r\n\r\nDMitch’s Response:  Actually,
    we saw the same QB for both.  It’s just his team actually adjusted to his shoulder
    filled throws in the second game."

  power_ranking_11_comments: "DMitch’s Take: QB Bill Cammas’ Mexican magic wasn’t
    enough to lead his team to victory.  Should he have eaten more Chipotle the night
    before?\r\n\r\nKozak’s Response: Brown wouldn’t have needed any Mexican magic
    to win the game if they had covered Staci Pugh.  Sick catch to win the game Staci!"

    shootouts this season because that defense is looking busted.\r\n\r\nDMitch’s
    Take: Well, Austin Plier did all he could to save the day.  Unfortunately, the
    Mighty Mouse act didn’t work too well for him."

    ones to be rimmed instead of doing the rimming.\r\n\r\nKozak’s Response: I did
    not receive my losing rimjob on Sunday.  Who should I speak to about that?"

    This time one year ago I was carrying you off the field.  Nice to see you out
    there kicking ass!  Now win a game.\r\n\r\nDurnald Mertchell’s Response:  First
    act was to get her out there again.  Now we’re working on winning the game.  Baby
    steps. :)"

    of Jackson and Wilkerson very cold in the W column.\r\n\r\nKozak’s Response: Sheerod
    Wilkerson was the king of avoiding INTs, but threw 2 pick-6s on Sunday.\r\n\r\n<img

    Have you seen how old this team is?  Just be glad they got through 1 half without
    having to take a calcium suppository."

    INTs???\r\n\r\nDMitch’s Take: Alex welcomed one of Kelly’s rookies in a monster
    way by snatching a pass out of his hands.  Too bad he gave it right back to them
    the next play."
