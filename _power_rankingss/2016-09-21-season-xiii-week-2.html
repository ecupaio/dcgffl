    QB Miles Patrie. Stay home Miles. Your team does not need you.\r\n\r\nDMitch’s
    Response: They beat Red though…we can’t give Old Man Holihan TOO much credit for

  power_ranking_6_comments: "DMitch’s Take: Brown has the potential to be good or
    #22. Only beating White by 1 TD doesn’t speak volumes. Which one will it be?\r\n\r\nKozak’s
    Response: Don’t expect a trophy this season…Bill Cammas only wins those every
    6 season. Season 15 championship is all his."

    machine…well it doesn’t hurt to have a Jordan Anderson littering up the score
    sheet either.\r\n\r\nKozak’s Response: Black better pray that Haskell Noyes doesn’t
    contract the Black Plague down in Brazil. Hotchkiss held his own, but they need
    their QB to be a threat this season."
