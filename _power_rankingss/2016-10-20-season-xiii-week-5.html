  power_ranking_0_comments: '<span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>DMitch’s Take:</em>
    Still sitting atop the Power Rankings, but I wonder how many refs they had to
    top (or bottom) for those two wins on Sunday?? #QTNA  <em>Kozak’s Response:</em>
    Sometimes it is better to be lucky than to be good.  Royal is getting close to
    making league history by going 10-0.</span>'

    We are back to vintage Bill Cammas football…which makes for boring Power Ranking
    comments.  <em>DMitch’s Response:  </em>Lies!  I can still talk about how he buries
    himself in pity tortillas to console him over the INTs he throws.</span>'

  power_ranking_2_comments: '<span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>DMitch’s Take:</em>
    Captain Dameron Rendell said he’s the headliner in this Vegas town, and showed
    it by littering up the scorecard.  <em>Kozak’s Response:</em> Congratulations
    to Sam Smallwood and his retirement from the DC travel teams!  It won’t be the
    same without you on the fields in Boston!</span>'

  power_ranking_3_comments: '<span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Kozak’s Take:</em>
    Lime is guaranteed to be 5-2 after they destroy Midnight on Sunday morning. <em> DMitch’s
    Response:  </em>I guaranteed Marvin Washington a winning record.  So far, so good.

  _power_ranking_4_ratio: field_27
  power_ranking_4_comments: '<span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>DMitch’s Take:</em>
    The Construction Crew (not to be confused with the Crew Club, which I heard was
    their team outing, but you ain’t heard that from me) are still in their winning
    ways.  Can QB Tony Stewart (who is about as old as Moses) lead them to the Promised
    Land?  <em>Kozak’s Response:</em> If old Peyton Manning can win a Super Bowl with
    the Broncos, why can’t Tony Stewart?</span>'

  power_ranking_5_ratio: "(4 - 2)"
  _power_ranking_5_ratio: field_27
  power_ranking_5_comments: '<span style="font-weight: 400;"><em> Kozak’s Take:</em>
    A short-handed Charcoal team almost took out the undefeated Royal team…I guess
    that counts as a moral victory.  <em>DMitch’s Response:  </em>Only in their minds.
     On the standings, it’s still an L.  </span>'

  _power_ranking_6_ratio: field_27
  power_ranking_6_comments: '<span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>DMitch’s Take:</em>
    Scott Graham…you are not 25 anymore.  Nor did you play like it after a Saturday
    night hangover.  <em>Kozak’s Response:</em> Don’t worry D, Scott can’t drink like
    he is 25 either.</span>'

  _power_ranking_7_ratio: field_27
  power_ranking_7_comments: '<span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Kozak’s Take:</em>
    It took two overtimes to beat Power Blue??  Get it together Cream Pies…  <em>DMitch’s
    Response:</em> To be fair, Greg Carter vs. Andy Allen was quite the battle.  The
    rest just sucked.  </span>'

  _power_ranking_8_ratio: field_27
  power_ranking_8_comments: '<span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>DMitch’s Take:</em>
    I am sure Black is happy to have their QB back.  They can finally start winning
    again. <em> Kozak’s Response:</em> Stop blowing up Haskell Noyes’s ego…his head
    is big enough as it is.  </span>'

  power_ranking_9_ratio: "(4 - 3)"
  _power_ranking_9_ratio: field_27
  power_ranking_9_comments: '<span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Kozak’s Take:</em>
    Kelly lost a heartbreaker to Royal.  But since Kelly never has a losing (or winning)
    streak, Safety Orange better watch on Sunday.  <em>DMitch’s Response:  </em>I
    got a quote that Brett Chambers was going to live in Tony Stewart’s underwear
    in the backfield.  Live from DCGFFL News Channel 5.</span>'

  power_ranking_10_comments: '<span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>DMitch’s Take:</em>
    So this is what Forest looks like when they face a real team?  Got it.  <em>Kozak’s
    Response:</em> How is this team 4-2?  I need answers. </span>'

  _power_ranking_12_ratio: field_27
  power_ranking_12_comments: '<span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>DMitch’s Take:</em>
    First they lose Mark Hofberg.  Now they lose David Schilling.  Is this team allergic
    to QBs?  <em>Kozak’s Response:</em> You better watch your back Marlon Davis.  No
    “QB” is safe.  </span>'

    Wake me when you beat an actual football team.  <em>DMitch’s Response:</em> Guess
    you’ll be asleep for quite some time, huh Sleeping Beauty?</span>'

  _power_ranking_14_ratio: field_27
  power_ranking_14_comments: '<span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>DMitch’s Take:</em>
    Can someone tell QB Jack Blaney that his passes are supposed to be thrown to HIS
    team and not the opposition?  I am sure Marvin Washington is somewhere still picking
    off this passes right now.  <em>Kozak’s Response:</em> 2-0 was a very long, long
    time ago for Sky Blue…</span>'

  power_ranking_15_comments: '<span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Kozak’s Take:</em>
    Poor Will Jackson.  He has played 4 seasons and probably endured 8 major injuries.
     Get better Will!  <em>DMitch’s Response:  </em>Man…he’s the DCGFFL’s version
    of Sam Bradford.</span>'

    Ummm…13 points won’t win you very many games.  I am hoping that QB Earl Armstrong
    remembers this.  <em>Kozak’s Response:</em> Larry Womack, Matt Murtaugh, and Keaton
    Fedak the night before Sunday’s game (and every game): <img class="aligncenter

  power_ranking_17_comments: '<span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Kozak’s Take:</em>
    This team is one injury away from forfeiting the entire season.  Literally.  <em>DMitch’s
    Response:</em> With Brandon Waggoner’s knees, more like .5 injury. </span>'
