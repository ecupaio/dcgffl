    .0001pt; background: white;\">Terry Yaki: Crimson’s defense, especially newcomer
    Mark’s 3 INTs made their opponent bleed.  Best team PERIOD?</p>\r\nGayJ:  Crimson's
    QB is something else.  I mean if he can win with this cast of nobodies, he can
    win with anyone."

    over Cerulean.  Defenses, listen up....QB BC runs in most of this extra points.\r\n\r\nGayJ:
     Olive, go away.  Just lose already."

    mark....perhaps everyone is distracted B/C he’s not wearing underwear.  DECOY.\r\n\r\nGayJ:
     I haven't worn underwear once and nobody has seemed to notice..."

  power_ranking_3_comments: "Terry Yaki:  Did someone put margaritas in the end zone
    for Barry?  Looks like it werq’ed.\r\n\r\nGayJ:  Lime is looking dangerous, shout
    out to my fellow \"100% straight\" QB Bryan Sanders.  Both of us are \"really
    good\" at being QB and being straight."

  power_ranking_4_comments: "Terry Yaki:  The Squirtles had the lead over undefeated
    Olive at halftime, but extra points hurt and they lost by one, but their stock
    went up!  Recommend bring a Daddie cheer squad out to the game...it help or distract
    Alonzo.\r\n\r\nGayJ:  Tough loss, maybe Jim should try running in some of those
    extra points."

  power_ranking_5_comments: "Terry Yaki:  This team won without Jamar who was off
    in Mexico getting engaged.  Maybe this team needs an engagement every weekend? 
    Who’s next?  *cough* Hofberg\r\n\r\nGayJ: Maybe this team just doesn't need Jamar..."

  power_ranking_6_comments: "Terry Yaki:  Beat undefeated Charcoal in a close one,
    and perhaps finding their (stroking) rhythm.\r\n\r\nGayJ:  You beat Charcoal by
    3 but only beat White by 4?  This team makes no sense."

  power_ranking_7_comments: "Terry Yaki:  First loss, although close, to the Dandy
    Lions.  Can they beat a QB-less and Drag Queen-less Crimson on Friday?\r\n\r\nGayJ:
     I hope so.  We are everything to that team.  EVERYTHING."

  power_ranking_8_comments: "Terry Yaki:  HOTTEST TEAM! OMG! I DIE.  They will be
    a contender if they can protect their QB.\r\n\r\nGayJ: Can't penalize them for
    losing to the leagues best team led by the leagues sexiest and most athletic QB
    (even with his center groping - instead of blocking - the other team all game)"

  power_ranking_9_comments: "Terry Yaki:  Looks like QB Pratt found a favorite target,
    and its not his wife....hello James Rowe (4TDs).\r\n\r\nGayJ:  Sky Blue is just
    padding their stats with wins over bad teams."

  power_ranking_10_comments: "Terry Yaki:  They definitely took all of it from Olive. 
    They need to utilize their drag queen more.\r\n\r\nGayJ: \"Utilize their drag
    queen more\" hmmm - where have I heard this 10,000 times before?"

  power_ranking_11_comments: "Terry Yaki:  Where are the peanuts?  This is a sleep
    (with h) er team!  Once their QB settles in...it could be lights out.\r\n\r\nGayJ:
     If they can figure it out, I wouldn't want to see them in the playoffs."

  _power_ranking_12_ratio: field_27
  power_ranking_12_comments: "Terry Yaki:  Brad Allen was the QBs favorite target
    with 3 TDs.  Despite losing a close one, this team moves up.  Way too many tops...I
    mean....too much potential.\r\n\r\nGayJ: If having a lot of tops was an indicator
    of potential, Crimson would be at the bottom of these rankings."

  power_ranking_13_comments: "Terry Yaki:  Maybe their QB needs to take pace off the
    ball?\r\n\r\nGayJ:  If  Vio-LIT is 14th, god help the teams ranked below."

  power_ranking_14_comments: "Terry Yaki: Yay to the first win, but they also lost
    one.  Another sleeper team.  Wait for Marvyn to explode on offense....it will
    happen.\r\n\r\nGayJ:  WTF happened in the second half of the game against Lime?!?! 
    They need Viagra to keep that Hardwood up."

  _power_ranking_15_ratio: field_27
  power_ranking_15_comments: "Terry Yaki:  TEAl won, but it was against Navy.  Maybe
    it's time to do some Army PT?  Peter?\r\n\r\nGayJ: TEAl still hasn't won a game
    in my book."

    this ship sinking?\r\n\r\nGayJ: Oh yes this ship is sinking. Quick! Z, save all
    the seaman!"

  _power_ranking_17_ratio: field_27
  power_ranking_17_comments: "Terry Yaki:  Perhaps this team needs to call the White
    House for some help?  Maybe ask the Orange team for insights?\r\n\r\nGayJ:  The
    White Russians play like they are drunk off White Russians.  Ok. Not my best. 
    But you don't deserve my best."

  _power_ranking_18_ratio: field_27
  power_ranking_18_comments: "Terry Yaki:  There’s no reason why this team should
    not have a win.  Maybe the captain should stop watching RPDR?\r\n\r\nGayJ: You
    guys are giving the Redskins a bad name.  Do you know how hard that is to do?!?!"
