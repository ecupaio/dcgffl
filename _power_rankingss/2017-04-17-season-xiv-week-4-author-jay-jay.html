  _power_ranking_6_ratio: field_27
  power_ranking_6_comments: If only these Jew Boys had picked up Sean B. and Adam
    S. they'd dominate DCGFFL, banking, Hollywood, and deli's. Super Jew Q Robbins
    fortifies his game with matzo and gefilte fish. Mazel tov.

  _power_ranking_8_ratio: field_27

  _power_ranking_11_ratio: field_27
  power_ranking_11_comments: This makes me cringe and rejoice. Superstar Q Matt can't
    seem to stay sober long enough to focus. Their losses don't make sense. With a
    Big Receiver like Max, how are they not winning. Captain Bobby saved the day with
    the short game.
