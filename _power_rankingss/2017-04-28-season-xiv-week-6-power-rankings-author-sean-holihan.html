  power_ranking_0_comments: "Trevor won’t stop going to circuit parties, Josh and
    Nocella have great jock strap collections, Ryan has a public sex fetish, Mike
    won’t stop blacking out at bars – this may be the quietest ratchet team in DCGFFL
    history.\r\n\r\n<b> </b><b> </b><b> </b>"

  power_ranking_1_comments: "This team of straight boys has ruined nearly every team
    they’ve faced like a bunch of Becky’s walking into a drag brunch.\r\n\r\n<b> </b><b>

  power_ranking_2_comments: "New game! Take a shot every time AJ throws a TD to someone
    not named Antwon. It’ll be the most boring hour of your life.\r\n\r\n<b> </b><b>

  power_ranking_3_comments: "Despite being one of the best teams in the league AND
    having Kenderdine on the roster, you’re not actually happy that they finally lost
    their first game. Unless you read JJ’s Power Rankings.\r\n\r\n<b> </b><b> </b><b>

  _power_ranking_4_ratio: field_27
  power_ranking_4_comments: "This might be the best Long Diep team since he and Steslicki
    got Silver to the Final Four a few years ago. The question is, can Long stay out
    of his own way and will Jordan murder his QB if he doesn’t?\r\n\r\n<b> </b><b>

  _power_ranking_5_ratio: field_27
  power_ranking_5_comments: "So many questions. Gave Crimson and Pink their first
    losses. But also lost to Yellow and Black. Who is this team? Three more games
    (Violet, White, and Royal) could leave Charcoal as the shakiest 8-2 team I’ve
    ever seen.\r\n\r\n<b> </b><b> </b><b> </b>"

  power_ranking_6_comments: "A weak conference has allowed Kelly to feast upon other
    teams for easy wins, despite a new QB who is quickly learning on the job. Speaking
    of feasting: Tackney’s baking &gt; OJ at safety\r\n\r\n<b> </b><b> </b><b> </b>"

  _power_ranking_7_ratio: field_27
  power_ranking_7_comments: "This team has a game manager QB with a ton of weapons
    to choose from and could be the best dark horse team in the league. Week 8’s game
    against Charcoal could give us a better idea of who this team is before they head
    into the playoffs. Also, I don’t do Jewish puns.\r\n\r\n<b> </b><b> </b><b> </b>"

  power_ranking_9_comments: "You want to root for this team. The name is nice and
    the people on it are nice but it’s like watching your drunk friend hit on someone
    – you want them to succeed, but you know how it’s going to end.\r\n\r\n<b> </b><b>

  _power_ranking_10_ratio: field_27
  power_ranking_10_comments: "Injuries and absences have really hurt this team. Losing
    Jared for the season was a tough break and leaves them with very little room for
    error. With Mable, Boylan, Nix and company, this group could still surprise a
    couple teams in the playoffs. Connolly could also show up on time for game day,
    but let’s not get crazy.\r\n\r\n<b> </b><b> </b><b> </b>"

  power_ranking_11_comments: "Despite a great supplemental draft pick, Teal has still
    just gone 2-2 thereafter. The season is going to wind up the way it started, with
    DMitch drunk somewhere and Teal losing.\r\n\r\n<b> </b><b> </b><b> </b>"

  _power_ranking_12_ratio: field_27
  power_ranking_12_comments: "A win on Sunday against Cerulean doubled this team’s
    win total. On paper, this is a talented and experienced team that should be able
    to hang with anyone. On the field, they just haven’t been able to put it together.
    You ever seen crazy parents yelling at someone while their nice kids are just
    waiting for them to finish? Yeah.\r\n\r\n<b> </b><b> </b><b> </b>"

  power_ranking_14_comments: "Violet’s two wins have come against Red and White. If
    this team were a dog, it would have been mercifully put down weeks ago. Instead,
    we’re forced to listen to its death rattle for weeks.\r\n\r\n<b> </b><b> </b><b>

  _power_ranking_15_ratio: field_27
  power_ranking_15_comments: "Jack Blaney gets White its first win by almost singlehandedly
    beating the bREDskins with two TD’s to Rob Casey, another running TD, and 3 INTs,
    including a pick six. Shout out to Bartel for running back an INT on a try for
    2 (the margin of victory). That W came against Red – the next two games are against
    Pink and Charcoal. Don’t get used to this feeling.\r\n\r\n<b> </b><b> </b><b>
