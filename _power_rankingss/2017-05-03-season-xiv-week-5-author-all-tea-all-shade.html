  power_ranking_0_comments: Is the pimento about to be pulled from Olive now that
    they’ve lost one of their stars? Seems like the rest of league won’t be green
    with envy much longer.

  power_ranking_1_comments: How do they keep winning? Rumor has it they don't have
    set plays. Rumor also has it Terri Yaki is no longer a blouse. Bom Dia!

  power_ranking_2_comments: Short QB. Short Captain. Short handed and came up short
    against Olive on Sunday. Please tell us at least one of them is hung. We know
    it’s not Garbage Human Trash Fire.

  power_ranking_3_comments: Charcoal continues their winning streak. What's next for
    this All-Bro team? Bate buddies and on-field vaping? “Duuuuuude it’s not gay if
    we’re drunk.”

  power_ranking_5_comments: The last kween to squeal as much as captain Jordan Anderson
    was Sandra from 227. Oooooooh hey Maaaaary. Someone put a d$ck in that mouth stat!

  _power_ranking_6_ratio: field_27
  power_ranking_6_comments: Since the whole league wants to sleep with them, we decided
    to play “Marry/Fuck/Kill” with their roster. Not surprisingly, the answer to all
    three is Scott Kelly.

  power_ranking_7_comments: MVP (Most Valuable Pratt) award once again goes to Linda.
    Center Miles is having a great season, breaking the record for most VPL selfies
    posted in a week! Can we get a VPL Sally Up Down video from ginger James this
    week?

  _power_ranking_8_team_name: field_26
  power_ranking_8_ratio: "(4 - 4)"
  _power_ranking_8_ratio: field_27
  power_ranking_8_comments: If their QB had Lions as linesmen they might be able to
    score more long balls. Will these tabby cats do more than purr in the playoffs?
    We think so, this is our sleeper final 4 pick.
  _power_ranking_8_comments: field_28

  _power_ranking_9_ratio: field_27
  power_ranking_9_comments: Captain Nix complains weekly, “I said go ahead, take a
    chance, draft the always-late 65 year old QB.”  Oh. OK. We see. You think these
    continual losses have nothing to do with you. You go to your closet and you select…
    we don’t know… that lumpy blue jersey for instance because you’re trying to tell
    the kaweens that you take yourself too seriously to care about always being on
    your back. But what you don’t know is that that jersey is not just blue, it’s
    not turquoise, it’s not lapis. It’s actually cerulean. And you’re also blithely
    unaware of the fact that in 2010, Enrique de la Perez did a collection of Venezuelan
    cerulean gowns. And then I think it was Yves Snight Laurent… wasn’t it, who showed
    cerulean military jerseys? I think we need a jockstrap here. And then cerulean
    quickly showed up in the collections of eight different seasons. And then it,
    uh, filtered down through the straight leagues and then trickled on down into
    some tragic Universal Gear boutique where you, no doubt, fished it out of some
    clearance bin. However, that jersey represents millions of tricks and countless
    loads and it’s sort of comical how you think that you’ve made a choice that exempts
    you from the responsibility of your failing season when, in fact, you’re wearing
    the jersey that was selected for you by the people writing these Power Rankings.
    That's all.

  power_ranking_10_comments: 'We used to like orange. Then Donald Trump and Patrick
    Mabray ruined it. If they scored as often as Kevin C. sends Facebook notifications
    they might be undefeated. #unsubscribe At least they got Seaton. Hey Boo!'

  _power_ranking_11_ratio: field_27
  power_ranking_11_comments: QB Jack Blaney’s bait bus sabbatical has done this team
    goooooood! Can El Jefe afford to keep him blindfolded and happy? With the Venezuelan
    bolivar at an all time low, our sources say not likely.

  power_ranking_12_comments: 'Captain Snight: Your weekly costumes have us gagging
    on your eleganza, but your Swan Lake performance on the field left us with feathers
    in our mouths. I’m sorry my dear, but  your team is up for elimination. Now pas
    de bourree, away!'

  power_ranking_13_comments: Lesquirt James’ TRANSition to cone is going well! But

  power_ranking_15_comments: Nessa guuuuuurrrrl! Fuschia’s hair is laidT down to the
    mother goose nursery rhyme giving you two goose egg realness. Forfeit both double
    headers? The only labels for this designer team are located at the outlet mall.

  _power_ranking_17_ratio: field_27
  power_ranking_17_comments: 'This team needs to take some advice from Ryan Shealy
    and #beitsownsuperhero or it''s one and done come playoffs. If this team focused
    less on gym selfies and more on route running then they might move up in the power
    rankings.'

  _power_ranking_19_ratio: field_27
  power_ranking_19_comments: After Sunday’s performance against White, these Game
    of Hoes felt nothing but shame, shame shame. However, like Cersi’s fall and rise,
    they fidna blow shit up in the end. Captain Abacus PrEP Chambers exclaims, “Where
    are my faggons?!”
