    Prince Albert joke and y'all had to ruin it by making me talk\r\nabout 2nd ever
    undefeated season blah blah blah.  With Brice's\r\nachilles injury, it'll be tough
    for Cammas to pierce his way to a 4th\r\nchampionship."

    weird looking guy over there with his shirt off\".  My last act\r\nas Commish? 
    Declaring Treasurer Tom Loughran didn't meet the 5 game\r\nminimum game requirement
    this season.  #FyreFestivalGoneWorse"

    about RJ so I'm just going to mention that a handful of their\r\nplayers could
    actually be vampires.  It'll be interesting to see if\r\nanyone is able to put
    a stake through this team's heart this weekend."

  power_ranking_3_comments: "This might be the most boo'ed up team I've ever\r\nplayed
    on which might explain the recent skid.  Master Splinter Brett\r\nChambers has
    been giving us all the inspirational GIFs this week, so I\r\nfeel confident that
    I'll be able to peace out this joint with my first\r\nchampionship."

  power_ranking_4_comments: "Pretty sure this team watched Wrestlemania\r\ntogether
    as a team-bonding event, they're so bruh-tastic.  It might\r\nexplain how Kory
    ended up in a headlock in handing Pink their first\r\nloss."

  power_ranking_5_comments: "This team was chomping at the bit to be the dark\r\nhorse
    (can I say that, Jamar?), but as much as this team has improved\r\nover the course
    of the season, I think they will get bit by a tough\r\nLime matchup.  Happy Mother's
    Day Mrs. Hofberg!"

    since they are in my side of the bracket.  So, I've asked my\r\nfiancé to come
    watch our potential matchup and direct a wide-zoom lens\r\non CJ's waist the entire
    game"

  power_ranking_7_comments: "The team that sleeps together wins together?   Maybe\r\nthe
    DCGFFL next season will print names and numbers on all the jerseys\r\nlike Jordan
    did for his team.  I'm sure Randy can come up with 260+\r\ncute nicknames."

  power_ranking_8_comments: "This is my favorite team because of all the\r\nreffing
    help they've given us this season.  But after I retire, I'll\r\njust go back to
    hating each and every one of them all the same.  What\r\na prick, that Andy Pratt"

  power_ranking_9_comments: "This team gave Crimson a little bit of a scare in\r\nthe
    first half with only 7 players last week.  The whole league is\r\ntalking about
    Rachel's double move on her TD Run-and-Catch.  This team\r\nis a wild-card come
    the playoffs (and also incredibly boring to make\r\nfun of)."

  power_ranking_12_comments: "I can't wait to see what Randy stitched up with all\r\nof
    our extra cleat bags.  DMitch is having a nice debut as a backup\r\nQB, and lucky
    us! We will be hearing about it for the next 6 months."

  power_ranking_17_comments: "So I bet Andy $50 halfway thru the season that they\r\nwouldn't
    win a single game and then they won 3.  Including against\r\nPink (I wasn't there)! 
    WTF!  Yeah maybe the commish shouldn't be\r\nbetting real money on these types
    of things, but with Team Hangover\r\nover here, I thought it was pretty safe."

  power_ranking_18_comments: "Speaking of... How did they win a game?  All of that\r\nveteran
    talent, and they don't even want to show up to play with QB\r\nJon.  I was going
    to try to not call him out, but then I found out\r\nhe's a Pens fan so - F* him."
