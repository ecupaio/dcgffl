    GAYJ Reust! I don’t know why you gagging, she bring it to you every week. The
    support Crimson received from the crowd was incredible. As in my parents are incredible
    and the only ones that cheered for the Scarlett O’HeyBoys. Best. Team. Period.

  power_ranking_4_comments: Their hilarious exit to Royal in overtime kept this perennial
    super bowl attending pile of garbage QB out of the ‘ship for the first time. Sanders
    holds this loss squarely on his tiny child-like shoulders with two ints in crucial

    on you Fuchsia and Olive. Also good job Navy I guess, you were able to be a football
    team for two games all season.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-BOg-P7iOoaQ/VbaIi06c4uI/AAAAAAAAEMk/uK3n-vf56vc/s1600/crococile%2Btears.gif\"
