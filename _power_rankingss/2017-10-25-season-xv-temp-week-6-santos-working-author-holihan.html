  power_ranking_1_comments: Bill Cammas could throw for 17 TDs, rush for 5, and catch
    28 INTs and some of y'all would still not give this man an MVP. I promise, he
    only pretends to be a jerk, but is all mush on the inside.

  power_ranking_9_comments: 54 points is a ton of offense, but allowing 53 points
    is not the stuff of championship teams. I mean, you guys allowed Purple to hang
    40 on you. Try, I dunno, rushing or bumping on the line or something.
