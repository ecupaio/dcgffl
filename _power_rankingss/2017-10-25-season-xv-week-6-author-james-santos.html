  power_ranking_0_comments: The good news is, Forest may be the team to beat with
    their win over Black, the Bad news is Cameron Burrell campaigns wayyyyyy better
    than Bill Cammas to win season XV’s MVP!  I’m sure Cammas will receive at least
    one more Letter of Reprimand from the board before the season is over!

  power_ranking_1_comments: "Cameron Burrell may campaign better against an unlikely
    MVP selection in Bill Cammas; however, if QB Scott Graham continues to throw more
    balls to token hetero (and I use hetero lightly) Brian Sanders, be prepared to
    see 72 hours of nonstop Snapchats and Facebook posts about “time wasted” … STAY
    TUNED and follow Cam at\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-5992\"

  power_ranking_3_comments: I ain't one to gossip and you ain't heard it from me,
    but it looks like Captain TJ’s plan worked perfectly and Sand pulled out the win,
    and from the looks of pictures floating around the league the only thing Ken Green
    caught last week was the “D”

    BB’s footsteps and took a “Spiritual” journey of his own this past weekend.\r\n\r\nThe
    question is did the rest of the Bananagrabbers go with him, since they clearly
