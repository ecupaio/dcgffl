    talent on the field this season and he is clearly the frontrunner for league MVP.

  power_ranking_1_comments: "Rumor has it that Jordan Anderson had one of his star
    rookies bomb their tryout so he could pick them up in a later round. Girl, you’re
    already an ex-D1 college football player, do you really need to use gamesmanship
    in a league where Sam Brown is earning MVP honors?\r\n\r\nAlso, I’m still feeling
    conflicted about how pretty Remi looked in that wig last week."

    Hofberg™ and Greg Carter continued their season of dominance with a win over a

    Stewart was the smartest QB in the league and now I’m questioning my </span><em><span

    Also, Sam Brown might be the sweetest person in existence and I now feel bad about
    my earlier joke. I blame Jamar for this.</span>'
