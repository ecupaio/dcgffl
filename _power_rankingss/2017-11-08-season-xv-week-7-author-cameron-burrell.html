  power_ranking_0_comments: "With yet another statement win, Whorange clinched a #1
    seed. Who would have thought that drafting a bunch of bottoms would land first-time
    captain Steven Gong on top!? During their first-round bye, the team is planning
    an intervention to help a questioning Bryan Sanders out of the closet/trashcan.
    If Bill Cammas could do it, so can you! Wait, Cammas hasn’t come out yet?! …Gurl,

  power_ranking_1_comments: "The Black team, aka Jordashians (aka Regina George and
    the plastics) is definitely one of the teams to beat. In a commanding win over
    the Orange team, Captain Jordan Anderson continues to put on his show of talent
    and athleticism that the rest of the league is just trying to keep up with. But
    if you’re also listening, you might be less than impressed with his Janet Jackson
    whisper vocals...\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-medium\" src=\"https://m.popkey.co/d0ee21/9Elxg.gif\"

    of a team. Also, I firmly believe the SandJobs are unshadable (trust me, it’s
    a word). Good people, ample amounts of talent, and athleticism… How could a team
    like this not win the championship this year? Well, kind of like this team…\r\n\r\n<img

    Beyoncé. She turned to Captain Evan B. and said, “You’ve worked hard all season
    long, Captain. Just sit back. I’ll take care of business this week.”… And that
    she did with a TD and INT over Graphite! …Yes, Lindsay, you better SLAY and cater
    to your man …I mean, Captain.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-medium\" src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2015-06/26/16/enhanced/webdr02/anigif_original-grid-image-31495-1435351313-4.gif\"

  power_ranking_4_comments: I’m not one to subscribe to false narratives and ignorant
    stereotypes. So let's just say it was real "stingy" of Adam Robbins and Adam Strasburg
    to keep every stat against Neon Green for themselves. Greedy Mofos! If only they
    weren't too cheap to buy their QB a much needed new shoulder and knee to help
    keep their championship dreams alive. Till then Brandon will just have to keep
    drinking from ‪the fountain‬ of youthful PA twinks.

  power_ranking_5_comments: Orange lost to the extremely talented Black team! That
    just sounds wrong. This loss is a wound that I won’t dig deeper into. Trust me;
    Orange’s performance was bad enough. Maybe it was because QB RJ wasn't there,
    but no one really noticed as the next cute-straight-white-guy CJ slipped right
    in as QB.

    Cameron’s social media activity and more concerned about the status of his wounded
    and failing team. Don’t worry sis, I’ll teach you how to \"Towel Tuesday\" and
    win at the same time! However, first you need to get one of those tasks right
    before taking on the other. Anyway, tune into Cam’s Snapchat for “Washcloth Wednesdays!”\r\n\r\nSantos...\r\n<img

    Side Note - Ever wonder how it must feel to be Dameron Rendell carrying around
    all that booty? Just ask Nikki Kasparek. She's been carrying this talented but
    under-performing Slate team all season.\r\n\r\nThis really is my favorite team
    to support every week. No, not to painfully watch an old dog attempt to learn
    new tricks cc: Donald Mitchell playing QB this season. However, it's to stand
    on the sidelines and stare at my league crush from afar.\r\n<img class=\"alignnone

  power_ranking_8_comments: Though Power Blue suffered a second-half collapse to Purple,
    Aaron Beck showed up and showed out, earning the MVP this week for his team. Hey
    Aaron, that’s a good thing, be happy, smile, do anything that shows you have even
    the least bit of human emotion. I'll settle for two blinks and a finger twitch!
    Anyway, this is a team I’m rooting for in the playoffs.

  power_ranking_9_comments: Typical AJ Reust to resort to trash talking when his team
    is getting their butts kicked. Hey, AJ ...School was in session and our rookies
    provided you with lessons all game long. My TD over you at the end was simply
    to drive their points home. Shout-out to Bryan Sanders for the idea! But, let’s
    talk about the person who we all know wears the pants on this team. Ms Livingstone
    put a hit on me off of the line that literally left me speechless. *Insert those
    dramatic hand-claps that make everything sound more dramatic* “I. WAS. NOT. READY.”
    Well done, Amanda.

  power_ranking_10_comments: "Graphite lost to a tough Forrest Green team this week.
    What were they thinking taking on the likes of Bill Cammas and Lindsay Walton
    without Captain Alonzo Mable? Instead of being there for their teams, I heard
    he and Jamar Walker took their go-go gadget knee braces to the dance floors of
    Cali!\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-medium\" src=\"https://media2.giphy.com/media/r52xR8XLhq1Zm/giphy.gif\"

  power_ranking_11_comments: Kelly Green steam-rolled Royal Blue 36 – 0! Wait, it
    was a forfeit? Like, Kelly Green was just given those points? OK, well that makes
    sense now. Ain’t no way in hell Kelly Green is beating any team 36 – 0! I thought
    I was reporting alternative facts. Well congrats Kelly Green. Kill it in the playoffs.
    You guys definitely have some weapons on your team. Haha ...again with those alternative
    facts!

  power_ranking_12_comments: 'My morals won’t allow me to shade someone based on age,
    rapidly declining skills and abilities, or someone that couldn’t catch a cold
    in the North Pole. So pretty much the majority of this team is safe this week.
    Which is fair given their victory over Power Blue without behemoths Gerard Burley
    and Jason Deters (Hmm maybe this team is better without them?). Also, what’s with
    shading Sam Brown for earning the MVP? He''s dedicated and hard-working. I respect
    that. However, who is this kickball cross-over, Matt Pesesky that earned MVP this
    week? #MakeMVPsGreatAgain'

  power_ranking_14_comments: Speaking of which, Neon Green lost terribly to a stingy
    Baby Blue team… Apparently, this team is ok with losing and just wants to have
    fun. Well, next season could you do us all a favor and just sign up for Stonewall
    Kickball? I mean, really! Men at work here.

  power_ranking_15_comments: Teal is so much better than their 3 - 6 record suggests.
    Allow this team to find their stride in the playoffs and there’s no telling what
    could happen. However, I refuse to give you props for your victory over Red this
    week. That’s like a parent paying their child to make their bed. NO! That’s just
    something that’s supposed to happen.

  power_ranking_16_comments: Dear iCandy, Andy Allen. If you don’t want to show up
    for the games to aid your team, at least show up to help the opposing team pass
    the time by. For some, staring at you for an hour and a half is worth the pointless
    on-field play stomping all over your team. I think I speak for the league with
    that one. Bryant Burnheimer, could you also help out with Bryan Sander’s intervention?
    I heard this league helped you out of the closet as well. It would be good to
    have someone that Sanders could look up to.

  power_ranking_17_comments: I can’t believe I’m about to give a team with so much
    talent props for just barely beating a struggling Gold team. What more can this
    league do to better support you guys? You received a supplemental pick. That makes
    three top travel players on the team and you’re still only 2 – 7. Well, at least
    you all look pretty in pink!
