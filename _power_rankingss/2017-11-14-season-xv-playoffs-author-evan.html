  power_ranking_0_comments: "Little does Jordan know that next season, I’ve got my
    friends Barry Mitzherald, Leon Zanders, and Sandy Boss joining the league. But
    don’t worry, they’re washed up and should all go in the 11th round.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    when did you get here, skinny Guy Fieri??\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-medium

  power_ranking_1_comments: These power rankings (and snapchat) have seen enough attention
    paid to Russell Westbrook's, er I mean Cam Burrell’s stat chasing, so let’s give
    it up for the true MVP Scott Graham, who led the highest scoring offense, threw
    only 3 INTs, and managed to never get sub-tweeted!

  power_ranking_2_comments: Yes, Sand has done a great job getting to the semis with
    only one loss along the way. And yet, I can't shake the feeling that this team
    is the Justin Guarini to some other team's Kelly Clarkson. Who's Justin Guarini,
    you ask? Exactly.

  power_ranking_3_comments: 'I can''t decide what I''m more jealous of: Slate, not
    Forest, being the three seed to make it to the final four, or the 1000+ likes
    that Jamar got on his engagement post on facebook.'

  power_ranking_4_comments: There once was a possibility that Baby Blue could win
    it all. There's complete certainty that I will wake up on the Monday after the
    championship party to approximately 764 pictures of JC sticking his tongue out.

  power_ranking_5_ratio: 4 - 5
  _power_ranking_5_ratio: field_27
  power_ranking_5_comments: 'If only DCGFFL had post game press conferences. I can
    see it now: Paul Guequierre arguing about the refs, Amanda and Tom half-heartedly
    defending their teammates while being embarrassed by them, AJ yelling about whatever
    AJ yells about, and Nix mumbling some words that may or may not be a sentence
    before grabbing a drink and/or taking a nap. And that assumes he even makes it
    to the press conference.'

  power_ranking_6_comments: "So, do you want to hear about my stats?!? Do you, do
    you?...Wait, I've already told you about them?...I've told you about them FOUR
    times?...Oh. Ok then.\r\n\r\n…Well, let me tell you again, because, gurlll, they
    are phe-NOMENAL!\r\n\r\nAnd while I'm at it, just putting it out there that we
    beat black and were once the number one team in the power rankings. I'm unilaterally
    deciding that matters for something."

  power_ranking_7_comments: "Things I aspire to: leading a pre-game chant as obnoxiously
    endearing as Power Yellow's \"\"This Shit is Bananas!\"\"\r\n\r\nThings I don't
    aspire to: following up that team chant with 5 out of 6 games lost to end the
    season."

  _power_ranking_8_team_name: field_26
  power_ranking_8_ratio: 5 - 4
  _power_ranking_8_ratio: field_27
  power_ranking_8_comments: Black's top four receivers are all under 5-10. Safety
    Orange has three garden gnome-sized wideouts. Purple, on the other hand, is led
    by four receivers all 6-3 or taller. Let this be a lesson to you, Joe Heron, to
    never underestimate the power of the twink.

  power_ranking_9_ratio: 6 - 3
  _power_ranking_9_ratio: field_27
  power_ranking_9_comments: Orange as a team was a lot like their QB, RJ. At first
    you think, "hmm, cute, nice, maybe there's a chance." Then you pay closer attention,
    get a bit bored, and end up shrugging your shoulders, say "eh whatever" and instantly
    forget about them.

  _power_ranking_10_team_name: field_26
  power_ranking_10_ratio: 5 - 4
  _power_ranking_10_ratio: field_27
  power_ranking_10_comments: So we've heard all about Kyle and his best Oprah impression,
    Kyle saying he's focusing only on the wins, Kyle straight up tackling yours truly.
    So let’s shine the spotlight on the always jolly Scott Kelly. Captains overshadowed
    by their big-ego, quick tempered QBs, unite!

  _power_ranking_11_ratio: field_27
  power_ranking_11_comments: "On power rankings past, Aaron Beck said in his picture
    with Steve Bannon that his face said it all, which is the same face he used in
    a picture with Delta Force. Let's take a look at other times he's used that face…\r\n\r\n<img

    at the White House bowling alley, with Jordan at a basketball game.\r\n\r\nPussy
    Whip Teammates, if you don't want to be compared to Steve Bannon, I hope for your
    sake there was no team photo after your loss on Sunday."

  _power_ranking_12_ratio: field_27
  power_ranking_12_comments: In recent seasons, Ken Green has been loud and lost a
    lot. This season he was (somewhat) quieter and lost a lot. Solution? Time to hang
    em up Queen Green.

  _power_ranking_13_team_name: field_26

  _power_ranking_13_ratio: field_27
  power_ranking_13_comments: "Let's play Jeopardy!\r\n\r\nAnswer: Bop It!, Octomom,
    the Graphite Team\r\n\r\nQuestion: What are three things you totally forgot existed
    until reading the answer to this question?"

  _power_ranking_14_team_name: field_26
  power_ranking_14_ratio: 3 - 6
  _power_ranking_14_ratio: field_27
  power_ranking_14_comments: After their playoff loss, Trainwreck was trying to convince
    me that Teal really was a 6-3 team with a 3-6 record. If everyone used Jim's version
    of math, then half the league would be undefeated, Teal would still be an 8 seed,
    and they'd still crash out of the playoffs early.

  _power_ranking_15_team_name: field_26
  power_ranking_15_ratio: 2 - 6
  _power_ranking_15_ratio: field_27
  power_ranking_15_comments: I really wanted to give Pink the number one ranking this
    week so Kozak can go out a champion in something. But then I had to ref that playoff
    loss. We'll see if we can find you a nice little frat bro as consolation (looking
    at you, Whorange supertwinks. Time to live up to that team name).

  _power_ranking_16_team_name: field_26
  power_ranking_16_ratio: 3 - 6
  _power_ranking_16_ratio: field_27
  power_ranking_16_comments: "At some point this season, you may have gotten excited
    about Royal's chances. You may also get excited about commercials with a nine
    year old scoring the winning goal, cleaning pubes out of your shower drain, or
    a new Iggy Azalea album.\r\n\r\nAll of which go about earning your excitement
    better than this Royal team."

  _power_ranking_17_team_name: field_26
  power_ranking_17_ratio: 2 - 7
  _power_ranking_17_ratio: field_27
  power_ranking_17_comments: "Number of wins this season: 2\r\n\r\nNumber of INTs
    thrown: 12\r\n\r\nNumber of times this team was called THOTs in the power rankings:
    all 10\r\n\r\nWatching Andy Pratt smile through the pain of yet another losing
    season: priceless*\r\n\r\n*Actually $75"

  _power_ranking_18_team_name: field_26
  power_ranking_18_ratio: 2 - 7
  _power_ranking_18_ratio: field_27
  power_ranking_18_comments: "You know that overwrought cliché about how nice guys
    always finish last? Yeah, thanks Red for keeping that one alive and well.\r\n\r\n**Also,
    insert what now seems to be obligatory reference to Andy Allen's swoon-worthy
    eyes here.**"

  _power_ranking_19_team_name: field_26
  power_ranking_19_ratio: 1 - 8
  _power_ranking_19_ratio: field_27
  power_ranking_19_comments: "Matt Murtaugh, resident Taylor Swift diehand/basic betch,
    with all this losing, is this what we made you do? Because this isn't good for
    your reputation. When that team was announced, I knew you were trouble when you
    walked in. And even though your QB asked twice on every play, it never seemed
    like you were ready for it. The losing did go out of style, and it was most certainly
    not in my wildest dreams. When it came to that 10 seed, we had a blank space baby,
    and we wrote your name. So here's to hoping that you and your teammates are never,
    ever getting back together.\r\n\r\nBut it's okay, you are out of the woods now.
    Wipe the teardrops from your guitar. I'm sorry I had to be so mean; I hope we
    don't got bad blood. The haters gonna hate hate hate hate hate. Shake it off,
    shake it off."
