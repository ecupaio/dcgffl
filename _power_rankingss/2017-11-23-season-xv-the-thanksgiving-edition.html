    got to the DCGFFL mountaintop with his best league and college friends. We should
    all be so lucky. Her deserves a sincere, shade-free congratulations. Great work,
    Captain.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m thankful Daniel Allen’s
    reportedly coming back in the spring to, in his words, “show (Jordan) how it’s
    really done.” Can’t wait to see how you try cheating the system, “Rookie.”</span>\r\n\r\n<span
    style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most of all, I’m thankful that a winning Smiffy is
    a fabulously-dressed Smiffy is a happy Smiffy is a Smiffy that doesn’t have anything
    to bitch to the board about. </span>"

    had a Cinderella story to root for in the championship game. I was disappointed
    -- we all were, alas -- their Pumpkin Carriage turned back into Dameron’s ass
    in the second half. “Bippity, boppity, bloop.”</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight:

  power_ranking_2_comments: "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m grateful for Cam’s
    MVP-worthy season. On offense, he boasted a league-best 17 touchdowns. On defense,
    he nabbed 3 INT’s and made a 3-safety set with the likes of Bryan Sanders look
    formidable. Yes, #Haters: This is another shade-free shout-out.</span>\r\n\r\n<span
    style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More so, I’m thankful Golden Whistle-winner Brandon
    Waggoner knew better than to throw a flag on Steve Gong’s Oscar-worthy flop to
    end their semifinal. You tried it, Captain. </span>"

    could claim one true, great, perfectly wholesome team this season. TJ and Mark’s
    ‘Jobs were talented, positive, hard-working, and successful. No Power Ranking
    author -- not Binder, not Cam, not even Jamar -- could shade them. And neither
