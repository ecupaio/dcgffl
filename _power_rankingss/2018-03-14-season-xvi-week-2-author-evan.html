  power_ranking_0_comments: Hold on to your hats, cue the gasp, and clutch the pearls,
    because I’m about to blow your mind. Mark Hofberg, of the He-Blues and Jew Kids
    on the Block … is Jewish. I know, I never would have thought so either.

  power_ranking_2_comments: 'I think I’ve solved what’s giving this team their blue
    balls: they’re afraid to ever go long and deep. Will an offense of only screen
    passes lead them to this season’s climax?'

  power_ranking_3_comments: Derrick, now that you’ve got a real QB and an all-world
    receiver, you and Andy can finally have your happily ever after. And before y’all
    roll your eyes (Tucker Biffel), I’m obviously referring to Patrick Tobin, who
    had not one, but TWO touchdowns overturned last week.

  power_ranking_4_comments: Leave it to the team with the bunch of straight bros to
    make a Golden Girls reference for their team name, only then to pick literally
    the most boring one.

  power_ranking_5_comments: The Atlanta Falcons in the Super Bowl, Scott Walker, Valentina,
    and the White Team. Congrats, you four! You all surprised everyone early and appeared
    successful. But also, my condolences, because your fates only lead to an epic
    crash and burn. Yes, Cake Monsters, I’m still doubting you.

  power_ranking_6_comments: "Teal’s got so many cones on that roster they’re looking
    like a construction zone. Ba dum chch.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-thumbnail\"

  power_ranking_7_comments: QB Brandon Waggoner’s profile pic is a news article announcing
    Mueller as special counsel, which you may say is a bit out of date. Fitting, because
    so is Brandon.

  power_ranking_8_comments: "On paper, Purple has a ton of talent, good team chemistry,
    and won’t make any refs salty. And yet, when I read their team name and think
    about their season outlook, I feel like Daria at her most excited.\r\n\r\n<img

  power_ranking_9_comments: When they needed most to be alert, excited, and ready
    to go, Raspberry went limp and fell asleep. Kind of like Eduardo at SteamWorks
    in Chicago.

  power_ranking_10_comments: "Now introducing, without Beyonce or Kelly, Destiny’s
    Bastard Baby! The rest of the league hopes Jordan and Dameron have more basketball
    tournaments in their future, because that team of Michelles and Latavias will
    not survive and keep on survivin’.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-thumbnail\"

  power_ranking_11_comments: QB John Boyd is so amazing, he’s even learned how to
    bend space and time. Once the ball is set, he manages to scan the defense, lick
    his hands, walk back 15 yards, pick some lint from his belly button, contemplate
    his own existence, make a sandwich, stop off at church across the street, walk
    back to the line of scrimmage, eat said sandwich, spit on his hands again, give
    his center a love tap, yell READY READY, scratch his ass, and then finally hike
    the ball. Truly amazing!

  power_ranking_12_comments: Sopranos extra Antonio Giuseppe Cannoli Rigatoni Campanelli
    has been scoring TDs left and right. The only thing greater than his TD total
    is the number of thirsty queens wishing he’d pull a Bryant Burnheimer and come
    out already.

  _power_ranking_13_ratio: field_27
  power_ranking_13_comments: This team should take a page from Adam Rippon’s book
    and show up to the fields in butt pads and harnesses. Maybe then they’d be the
    least bit memorable.

  _power_ranking_14_ratio: field_27
  power_ranking_14_comments: Yes, I know he runs a company that all about being fruity,
    and I know he has his face painted like tinkerbell in his profile picture, but
    rookie QB Ben Hunt is straight, alright?!? (and once he gets the Blake Bortles
    out of his system and stops throwing INTs over the middle, he’ll probably continue
    the straight QB championship streak, so whoop-dee-fucking-doo for that)

  power_ranking_15_comments: "You know what’s cute? How Jack Blaney looks like this
    every time he catches the ball, no\r\nmatter where it’s thrown:\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone

    to actually win a close game."

  power_ranking_17_comments: 'Since the original was horseshit and thankfully didn’t
    win Best Picture, I’ve decided to update the plotline: Three Billboards Outside
    Carter Barron. Destroyed and Embarrassed. Still No Wins. How Come Captain Piferoen?'

  power_ranking_18_comments: Man do I love me some Tiffany Haddish. She’s young, fun,
    energetic, knows how to grapefruit, and is always down for a good time. So what
    does Tiffany Haddish have in common with the orange team? Absolutely nothing.
