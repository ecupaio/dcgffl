  power_ranking_1_comments: "Aaron Beck is Power Blue’s Captain.\r\n\r\nAaron Beck
    shows up early to set up fields.\r\n\r\nAaron Beck drafts supplemental players
    so everyone who wants has a chance to play.\r\n\r\nAaron doesn’t yell at refs
    (all the time).\r\n\r\nBe like Aaron Beck."

  power_ranking_2_comments: Sam Brown forgot to account for St. Patrick’s Day when
    he drafted Team Straight, but even hungover and without Vinnie and with only one
    replacement, they still beat the Hunt Punters.

  power_ranking_3_comments: Calfee coming back to the League to beat AJ is like the
    original Superman coming back from the dead to defeat his replacement (you’re
    welcome Jared).

  power_ranking_8_comments: In the first three weeks, Ken Green has received only

  _power_ranking_9_ratio: field_27
  power_ranking_9_comments: You could pretty much bet money that this team will be
    SO NICE and also finish at .500. The question is can they push themselves into
    a semifinals team?

  power_ranking_13_ratio: 1 - 2
  _power_ranking_13_ratio: field_27
  power_ranking_13_comments: Sunday’s win over Kelly might be more due to the fact
    that Kelly’s receivers dropped more balls than a boy’s choir than anything Hotchkiss
    did.

  power_ranking_14_team_name: '6366'

  _power_ranking_14_ratio: field_27
  power_ranking_14_comments: In one game, Secondary QB Greg Carter has scored nearly
    as much as Primary QB RJ Martin has in three. What’s the over/under for when Jens
    will petition the Board for a replacement?

  power_ranking_18_comments: Donald Mitchell decided to come back right in time for
    his friend Jamar to go 0-3. Sources tell me that Jamar has just been acting old
    all season so that he could grab DMitch in the supplemental draft.
