    combo (Antwon/AJ) as last season, same jersey color, still everyone’s least favorite
    team. Though, tiny force Jack Blaney was the real standout this week and proved
    this roster is more than AJ’s gnarly manbun. The team this week:</span>\r\n\r\n<img

    a deep post before tumbling into the mud for a near TD against Cammas’ Teal team
    is all you need to know about this team’s depth. Dominant on offense with a litany
    of studly man-machines, and with a little tightening on defense, give us another
    week or two to be #1 atop the Kozaks. You cant stop us, you can only hope to contain
    us. And sorry if you don’t hear back, we’ll be leaving the rest of the league’s
    texts on read. </span>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/72QsjIhuN25doSmX0suFJGYcPgUxrOiQ5gXWzIdeF6FUmNLZu721C_KT7kajCUBQTlwjfxZPivAG2gdB6Pv4ChX-pdIp0sM3QwHQkKjVIPIgpQ6zv6u8SZ2FXFytORZEqW7k9nwL\"

  power_ranking_3_comments: "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hotch’s team is the
    real deal. Yeah, I said it. Your favorite Commissioner has put together a talented
    and versatile team that fits his QB style (possession WRs with good hands and
    size (Carter, Hogue, Shaginaw, Wilson) a nasty offensive line led by Mean Ken
    Green and Senior Statesman Tony Stewart, and a SLOW (like, think frozen molasses),
    churning offense that uses the ENTIRE. PLAYCLOCK. EVERY. PLAY. means your team
    will only get the ball 2x a half as they lull you to sleep. If Hotch keeps up
    with 1 turnover every two games, I’m calling SLEEPER ALERT (pun 3) on this team.

    seen this team play. Yes, they are 2-0, but I’m not convinced on paper they are
    the real deal. They beat a Marvin-less Teal week 1, and then a Kelly team that
    I’m not sure is top 8. I guess we’ll see. Ready to be proven wrong.</span>\r\n\r\n<img

    win in week 1 (28 points), team Graphene or Graphing Calculator (bunch of nerds
    on this team, led by my roommate Aaron) - or whatever shade of grey they are -
    proved that it was only because they played Maroon week 1 that they had people
    turning heads right off the bat. Granted they were in a shoot out with a top Gold
    team all the way through until falling apart late. Cameron “I-said-I’d-miss-every-regular-season-game-on-the-registration-survey”
    Burrell seems to be showing up weekly and playing hard, but I’m not sure they
    will end in the top 5 after the regular season. Still: </span>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/DOuvJmiin9fhyS_3TOGgbsUSvq9-eZ0x_rfmehXCdEcXHtY7jIBobcyp4z_R4sUIGpQ-2Zetw2uJvXtUqNZyc63JnbmuV2l2TPU8trJO\"

    of Cammas and Marvin last Sunday not withstanding, this team is aggressive, well-rounded,
    and not prone to mistakes. With Marvin \"likely to miss the first 4-6 weeks with
    a bad ankle... just kidding I’m here week 2\" Washington, Ben \"I'm the best WR
    in the league just ask me after 5+ drinks at the Goose\" McEvoy and Justin “Somehow
    I just Randy Mossed Andy Allen last sunday” Parker playing well, I would predict

  power_ranking_7_comments: "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This team reminds us
    of the Los Angeles rams without a Sean McBae – big name players favored to win
    preseason, yet finishing with no trophy. While I assume the Rams’ coach sideline
    handler has been solicited to ensure Pearce shows up to games, I’m still not sure
    this team has the Hollywood glam beyond its captain/QB combo to make a deep run.
    My guess is Hof-berg will be spending less time on the field this season and more
    time at the hof-brau.</span>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/CWfRsVyMYe6gk4-iM9H57qwL1vKJ6rMomw90KVcTiXEveHtFAOTPpMLT5k5feBa6gH3moDs-_fNi8LwdqJfzoX6w-jhiAJZ7K1dsC-zGAF14EA7vxZzScZaP7B4sOr4KBzmkdsgu\"

    more than to watch a Brandon Waggoner on field implosion. Watching his rocky,
    emotional games/seasons are like enjoying a strong Camembert – something about
    it feels off and expired, but its intense bouquet lends to a sweet and indulgent
    finish rarely found elsewhere on earth. I strongly suggest you try it. I predict
    at or around .500 with a potential for a playoff push provided his team doesn’t

    his first ever game week 1 and followed that by getting ravaged by Pink – which,
    as a straight qb in this league, doesn’t sound half bad. A decent roster and Derrick
    “I’m the best rusher in the league and I’ve had zero drinks” Johnson at the helm
    and this team could really go either way.</span>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/fqLo1BtZURm3RaJsXBR2y81fepYTimL5sy4SCx-9Fi0RTj0VDaJyaSiirmBO8CCy7TVIJHUXWFCW5tUVxBh0FaIH6K9y5MtFx6jbwmYGrk1ke5yb03O0oaeB3Z9ALatScF9zWCal\"
