  power_ranking_0_comments: Fresh off calling a gay bowl championship defense, QB
    Brandon Waggoner has gone eight weeks without throwing a single INT, which is
    an entirely unconfirmed DCGFFL first. The clear league MVP favorite with one week
    left.

  power_ranking_1_comments: 'There are three certainties in life: Death, taxes, and

  power_ranking_4_comments: Lost in the fray of Brandon’s historic season, fellow
    AARPer Jim Connolly has quietly had a big- time resurgence. Who knew throwing
