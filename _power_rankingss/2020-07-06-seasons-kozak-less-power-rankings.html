    this page contains witty (read: shady) recaps for the games, and rank the relative
    strength of each team in their division.  Once written weekly by sports commentary
    (read: shade) veteran Patrick Kozak, the tradition is carried on by a weekly rotation
    of league members.  Check back when the league is in season!"
