  results_0_comment: A solid debut by the Rear Admirals who led most of the way, up
    13-12 at the half.  Captain Brian Golden had his first DCGFFL TD catch in the
    first half.  Porter B. added a pick 6 to his resume in the second half.  Mike
    D. had 2 TDs in the loss.

  _results_1_mvp: field_43
  results_1_comment: This was a battle from the beginning.  Ninja Turtles' QB Jim
    Connolly started his season with a first-pass INT to Adam Robbins.  Unfortunately
    for the Bluekakke, Coach G started his season in similar fashion with the first
    two passes of this game being INTs.  Smiffy turned back the clock with a 4TD performance
    in the win.  Sam Smallwood had a chance to score the tying TD on the penultimate
    play of the game with a beautiful 70 yard pass from Coach G, but the pass needed
    to be 69 yards.  Bluekakke takes it all over the face in this one.

  _results_2_mvp: field_43
  results_2_comment: In this battle of first time QBs, Black's QB Charlie Lingafelt
    looked strong with a 4 TD performance.  Marlon D. (Maroon's backup QB) figured
    out how hard it is to QB in this league in the first half of the game.  But he
    was able to recover, tossing 2 TDs in the second half.  Newcomer Alonzo Mable
    came down with 2 TDs and an INT in his DCGFFL debut.

  _results_3_mvp: field_43
  results_3_comment: 'Leaf started off fast, going up 26-0 at the half with lots of
    players getting involved, including a sensational catch by captain Scott Steinhardt.  The
    Boehners finally got some offense going in the second half with MopTop grabbing
    2 TDs and LA Returner Mark Martinez added in a second half sack.  '

  _results_4_mvp: field_43
  results_4_comment: Howard Y. started his last DCGFFL season with a bang, scoring
    Purple's first TD of the season.  Jerrell (welcome back!) and Ali added the other
    two scores for the Gang.  And Sean G. sacked his hard-to-sack good friend Matt
    P in the first half.  Mike Hess, Baxter and Sam all filled up the stat sheet with
    scores for the Receivers in the victory.

    a 40 yard TD catch and WTF added a 2pt conversion from QB Kyle McKinney to give
    them a lead they''d never relinquish.  Newcomer QB Tyler L. held his own, scoring

    Lechert (1) and Jared Lucas (2) had scores for the Squirts along with Charlie
    Salem (1).  Stephen Tackney (2) and Dane Snowden (1) tore it up for Royal.  Teal
    pulled off the victory 25-21.

  results_7_comment: 'It felt like the first time lime had played together (oh wait,
    it was!).  At the half, however, Lime was holding their own, up 8-6.  But the
    second half started off with a TD to Jack Miles (who followed that up with 2 others
    as well) and the rout was on.  '

  _results_8_mvp: field_43
  results_8_comment: 'Welcome back to the league JB!  QB JB tried to run an offense
    with 6 receivers and no blocking but Butch Keith Combs told him, "No, sir" as
    he was on the QB practically when he got the ball in his hands on every play.  David
    Schilling used his one play to perfection, throwing for 5 TDs and catching two
    of JB''s INTs.  '

    of his Phite Club 35-12.  Kozak and Matt C. both had two TDs while Nick C. and
    Sam B. had TDs for the Club in the loss.  '
