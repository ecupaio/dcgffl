  results_0_comment: 'This was a back and forth game that pretty much hinged on an
    early interception by Andrew Carr for the Turtles.  He lept out of his shell and
    caught Hoes'' QB Scott Kisha''s INT on Royal''s first drive of the game.  The
    Turtles won 34-20.  '

  results_1_comment: Brick Hard ran into a tough team full of Johns on Friday Night
    with QB Daniel Honeycutt making his DCGFFL QB debut in the loss.  He did have
    one bright spot, as he picked off Leaf QB Mark Hofberg's pass and took it to the
    house to give Maroon it's lone score as Leaf won big 44-6.

    came up with a 4 point victory.  After being down by 14 at the half and by 2 points
    with less than a minute to go, QB Matt Pearce engineered a victory.  Baxter O'Brien
    caught the go-ahead TD pass on the next to last play of the game to sink the Tealers.

  results_4_comment: Lime took a 16-13 lead into halftime off TJ Rhone and Marcus
    Boyce TDs.  The Queens bounced back in the second half with Nikki having both
    2nd half TDs, as the Queens kept the Lime team winless on the season.

  _results_6_mvp: field_43
  results_6_comment: The Tealers had little left to squirt in this game, losing in
    blowout fashion 43-14.  The backbreaker was a 50 yard run by QB Craig Neiswanger
    on the last play of the half to put the Violets up by 2 scores.  That trend would
    continue throughout the game as the Gang ran over the Tealers.

  results_8_comment: The pinky-less David Schilling held his own in this Christmas
    bowl, throwing a couple of TDs to Jeremy Steslicki.  But the Rovers were just
    too much, as BB scored 3 TDs in this one to carry them to a 5 point victory and
    a 2-0 start.

  results_10_comment: 'The drag show didn''t drag in this first half, as Mike Zgoda
    led the way for Fuchia with 2 TDs and Fuchsia took a commanding lead into halftime.
    The Gays would make a second half run of it, with Mike D. and Robbie Ladd each
    adding a score, but alas, the Gays were on their knees at the end of this one
    31-23.  '

  results_11_comment: 'The Gang relied upon their staunch defense, taking a 14-0 lead
    into halftime with Sean and Howard each having scores.  The second half was an
    even affair, with both teams coming up with 2 TDS - Purple''s going to Howard,
    giving him 3 for the game - as the Gang did what they normally do at a Bluekakke.   '
