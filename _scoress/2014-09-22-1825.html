    a Big Queen beats your Average Gay every time, as the Queens won this one 39-26
    on Friday night.  The Queens took a 20-12 lead into halftime with Nikki and Billy
    K catching TDs.  Mike D. and Tim A. had first half scores for the Gays. The second
    half saw Billy K add another TD to his resume, while Tim A. and Josh E. got on
    the board for the Gays in the loss.   '

    of Friday Night Lights this past Friday.  B. Stokes had 2 TDs and an INT in the
    first half, with Chris Morse adding an XP and a sack, as the Kilos pounded the
    White team 14-0 at half.  The second half was much the same, with Captain Sean
    Stern adding 2 second half INTs in the victory.  '

  results_2_comment: 'Fuchsia held this one close in the first half without their
    starting QB, as backup Jason Clevenger thru a TD to Mike Z and ran an XP in.  The
    difference in the first half was a pick 6 by the Roving BB, as Red led 14-7 at
    the half.  The second half saw Ryan and BB score TDs for the Reds, as they won
    this battle by 2 scores, 27-13. '

    G. and Craig each adding a TD and Jerrell catching 2 in the first half.  The second
    half went to Royal, with Tyler scoring 2 TDs but the game was long over before
    then.  Purple doubles up Royal 40-20. '

    catches.  Maroon played hard, giving it their all until the end, with Trey Phillips

  results_5_comment: Lime felt for the first time what victory tasted like as the
    Rovers just couldn't send enough over to remain unbeaten on the season.  Lime
    led this one at half 14-0 on Justin's and Marcus's scores.  Then Red roared back
    with a TD by Matt and two rushing TDs by Kyle McKinney, only to come up short
    in the end 22-20.

  results_6_comment: In a early battle of unbeatens, the Newton-Johns said their own
    "Cowabungas" in beating the Turtles by 2 points.  Trainwreck (D. Green) and Mike
    Ben. (Leaf) had the two first half TDs, with Steve "I never get thrown to" Gong
    getting a second half TD for Leaf and Kevin K. doing all the scoring for Captain-less
    Turtles in the second half.  Leaf remains unbeaten on the season.

  results_7_comment: The first half scoresheet looks almost like it did before the
    game started, with the Greens having the lone first half points coming on Jeremy's
    TD, leading 6-0 at the half.  Justin did all he could in the second half for Lime,
    scoring once and having big catch after big catch in Lime's 20-8 loss.  Captain
    Kody's TD was called back on a jumping penalty, which was caught on camera and
    is in the weekly video.  Is it a jump?  YouDecide2014.

  results_9_comment: Black led the way over winless Pacific at the half 18-12 with
    Coleton, Ken and Trevor each having first half scores for the Black team.  But
    the second half was a different story as the Bluekakke decked the Black team,
    with Coach G scoring the winning TD with his legs.  Bluekakke wins its first game
    of the season 25-24.
