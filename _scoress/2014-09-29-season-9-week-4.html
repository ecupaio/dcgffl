    Tealers.  Long D. had a rushing TD and two passing TDs in the 1st half, as the
    Burnt Orange squad led 19-0 at the half.  The second half was much the same, with
    Moptop having two INTs and Alex adding one of his own as the Boehners won 32-6.  Jared
    L. had 2 INTs and John R. had 3 sacks and the lone TD for the Tealers, who fell

  results_4_comment: A tale of two halves with two magical plays determining the outcome
    of the game.  The first half saw the Kilos, with their backup QB Sean Stern, start
    fast, taking a 19-0 lead into halftime.  Nolan had two first half INTs, with Bugsy
    and Levert (welcome back!) each adding one of their own.  The Greens got the shot
    in the arm they needed on the first play of the second half with Judson W. returning
    the opening kickoff for Butch's first score of the game.  The game went back and
    forth until a 4th down for the Greens turned into a miraculous catch by Jamar
    W. in the endzone for a game-tying TD with very little time left.  Jamar then
    had what appeared to be the game winning XP catch as well.  But backup QB Bugsy
    led the Kilos down the field, and with 2 plays remaining in the game, threw a
    pass to the back of the endzone where Andy L jumped as high as he could to bring
    the ball down in bounds.  Game over.  This thriller went to the Kilos 32-27.

  results_5_comment: 'White looked like they Knew in the first half of this one, keeping
    it close under the direction of new QB Kyle B.  Vegas led at the half 12-7, with
    Captain Enrique P. and Josh E. each having a TD for the Gays.  The second half
    was a different story, with Brian S. having 2 INTs, one returned for a TD, as
    the Gay team ran away from White 33-13.  Andy Allen was the lone bright spot for
    the White squad in the second half, having a TD and an INT.  '

  results_6_comment: In a battle of winless squads, it was Hard to doubt the Brick
    team after they carried a strong first half performance into the second half.  Maroon
    led 20-6 at the half with Daniel H. having a Pick 6.  The second half saw Maroon
    grab a second pick 6, as Trey P. ran one back, his second TD of the game.  Patrick
    M. added a second half TD for the Hoes in the loss 40-14.

  results_7_comment: Black decked the Hoes, who have yet to figure out how to put
    it all together.  Black led 26-0 at the half off of 2 rushing TDs by QB Charlie
    L and two receiving TDs by Santos.  Santos added 2 first half INTs as well, with
    Ken Gr. adding his own.  The second half saw the Black team grab 4 additional
    INTs, one Matty P. turned into a pick 6, as black dominated 39-0.

    the Gays 21-14 off a Jeremy S. TD and a Judson W. TD.  The second half saw Jamar
    W. continue his impressive day with 2 TDs in a 34-20 victory.  The Gays Brian
    S. had 2 TDs as well, with newcomer Andrew W. grabbing a second half sack in the
    loss.  '

  results_9_comment: In a game of two very good teams, the Rovers carried a 13-12
    lead into halftime with QB Kyle M. rushing for a TD and throwing one to Jim R.  Bill
    C. had two first half rushing TDs for the Queens.  The second half saw Gabe A.
    come to life with an INT and a TD, as the Queens escaped 26-20 over Red, who fell
    1 yard short on a potential tying TD.

  results_10_comment: This was another tale of two halves with backup QB Jason C.
    leading the Fuchsia team on 3 first half scoring drives, one to Justin M (welcome
    back!) who also added a first half INT.  The second half, however, saw Fuchsia
    wishing to go Back to the First Half, as Navy's backup QB Pmac got into a groove,
    sustaining 3 TD drives, all leading to TDs to Dameron R.  John W. caught the game
    winning XP, as Navy pulled off the victory 26-25.
