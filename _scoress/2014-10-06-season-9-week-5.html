  results_0_comment: The first half of this matchup was a defensive battle, with each
    team scoring only once and the Gays taking a 7-6 lead into half off of Enrique
    P.'s TD.  The second half was a much more offensive game as 5 total second half
    TDs were scored.  Enrique added his second TD while BB matched him with 2 in the
    loss 29-20.

  results_1_comment: Graphite had a tough go of it in this game, falling backwards
    to the Fuchsia squad 40-12.  The first half saw Fuchsia hold Tony S. and crew
    scoreless as they took a 14-0 lead into halftime off a Pick 6 by QB Scott G.  The
    second half saw a burst of TDs from the Fuchsia team with Bill, Jason, Clay and
    Bihn all scoring, while Peter S. added a second half TD and INT in the loss.  Phite
    club comes out bruised.

  results_2_comment: 'In the shocker of the day, the Pacific team, who only last week
    beat a previously unbeaten Gold squad, this week pulls the opposite and loses
    to a previously winless Royal squad 24-6.  The Hoes picked off Pacific QB Coach
    G 3 times, with Tyler F. grabbing two and Captain Brian H. grabbing one of his
    own en route to the blowout.  '

  results_3_comment: 'The Gang rode out to a 28-6 halftime lead with QB Craig N. rushing
    for two TDs and Jerrell and Howard each catching one in the first half.  Newcomer
    John (welcome to DC!) had Hard''s lone first half score.  In the second half,
    Maroon settled down a bit, with John adding his second score of the game and Rob
    C. adding one of his own in the losing effort 36-19.  '

  results_4_comment: Turtle backup QB Matt N. kept the score close in this one, leading

    had 2 first half TDs to ensure B.O. went into the half smelling good.  The second
    half was similarly close, with Burnt Orange pulling out the victory 32-26.  Andy
    P. had a TD, XP and a sack in the second half for the win.

  results_6_comment: Lime's lone first half highlight was an INT by Marvin W. as the
    Kilos took a 7-0 first half lead.  Unfortunately, the second half wasn't much
    different, as the Columbia team blanked Lime 26-0, Brion had 2 TDs and an INT
    in the victory.

  results_7_comment: 'This game couldn''t have been closer in the first half with
    each team scoring twice to end the half tied up at 13.  Kozak and Matt C. were
    the big Queens in the first half with a TD each and Jeremy S. and QB David S.
    having the Butch teams first half TDs.  The second half could not have been more
    different, as the Queens had 3 INTs and ran away with it, scoring 3 times to 0
    in the second half, finishing off the Greens 34-13. '

    season squeaked out a victory over previously unbeaten Leaf 26-25.  Larry W. had
    a circus catch for a TD in the second half for the Johns and Tim S. had 2 second
    half TDs for the Gold team, the last one coming very late in the game as the game
    winner.  '
