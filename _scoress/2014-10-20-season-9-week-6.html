  results_0_comment: Black decked the whimpering Gang in the first half of this one,
    picking off Purple's QB 3 times (Kyle had 2, Captain Ken G. had 1) en route to
    a 20-0 halftime lead.  The Gang got its act together in the second half and came
    roaring back but TDs to Howard and Jerrell, along with a QB TD scamper weren't
    quite enough, as Black held off Purple 26-22 to get its 3rd win on the season.

  results_1_comment: 'Navy rode a great first half to victory in this contest.  TDs
    to Dameron, Will C. and 2 to John W. keyed the Admirals first half route 28-6,
    with Kyle S. adding 3 sacks.  John W. added his 3rd TD in the second half, as
    Navy cruised 34-13 over the Greens.  Judson W. had 2 TDs in the loss. '

  _results_2_mvp: field_43
  results_2_comment: The first half of this one saw an even number of TDs and INTs,
    as Graphite had 1 TD and 1 INT, with Red scoring 2 times and giving the ball away
    twice but managing a 13-6 halftime lead.  The second half saw the INT total rise
    to 5, as each team gave the ball away one additional time.  Red wins 25-18; JP
    & Shealy each have a sack for the Rovers.

  _results_3_mvp: field_43
  results_3_comment: Low scoring first halves seemed to be the theme of the early
    games, as these two were tied 6 all at the break.  Adam R. won his first game
    at QB as he led two second half TDs en route to a nailbiter 19-13 victory as the
    Boehner's last play heave came up just short.

  _results_4_mvp: field_43
  results_4_comment: This was a tough defensive matchup with the Tealers taking a
    12-0 lead into halftime thanks to TDs by Charlie S. and Jared L., as well as an
    INT by Jared L.  The second half was similar, with each team managing only 6 points
    each - the Johns off of a Dan H. TD at the end of the game and the Squirts off
    of Charlie S's second TD of the game.  Mark H. had 2 INTs in the loss.

  results_5_mvp: Sheerod Wilkerson (Navy), Steve Adamske (Orange)
  _results_5_mvp: field_43
  results_5_comment: This battle of the top two teams in the Nellies conference lived
    up to the hype, as the Admirals eeked out a 27-20 victory over the previously
    undefeated Queens.  At the half it was all tied up 7-7, with Will C. having both
    an INT and the lone Navy TD and Steve A. having the lone TD on a long run for
    the Queens.  The second half saw Matt C. adding a TD and a sack and Billy K having
    a score in the loss for the Queens.  John. W., Dameron and Captain Brian G. each
    had a second half score for the victorious Navy squad as they held on to become
    the top seed in the conference going in to week 7.

  results_6_comment: 'The Receivers were lacking a starting QB on Sunday, as their
    tough day began by getting blanked by the Turtles 45-0.  Jarod, Kevin and Chris
    R. each had 2 scores while Adam B added one of his own in this blowout victory.  And
    I''ve mentioned every single stat written down for Gold in this summary.  Look
    for it.  '

  results_7_comment: The Johns came off their loss to Teal with one thing on their
    minds - Victory.  They took it to the Bluekakke team, blanking them 33-0 in the
    second half of their doubleheader.  Shawn had a score for the Leaf squad and Mark
    H. added his 3rd INT on the day, while Markco had a sack, 2 ints, 2 tds, all while
    sucking a blue lollipop in the victory.

  results_8_comment: The Kilos held their own in this one despite missing a few players.  Andy
    had two first half TDs and an INT while Scott G. had 2 first half TDs to take
    a 20-13 lead into halftime for the Fuchsia team.  Scott added a third TD in the
    second half and Mike Z had what proved to be the winning score, as the Fuchsia
    squad held off the Kilos 33-25.

  _results_9_mvp: field_43
  results_9_comment: I Know, White made this one close for most of the first half,
    staying on par with the Queens until a costly INT to Billy K allowed the Queens
    to take a two score lead into halftime, up 19-7.  The second half saw Donald M.
    catch 2 TDs and Billy K. adding his second TD as the Orange squad proved why they
    are one of the top teams in the league, winning this one 40-13.

  results_10_comment: Royal took advantage of the Pearce-less Gold team, jumping out
    to a 20-0 halftime lead off of scores by Stephen T and two by Tyler Fox, who also
    added two first half INTs.  Baxter had a first half INT for Gold.  The second
    half saw Gold break its scoreless streak with Sam C. having a TD and Baxter adding
    the 2pt conversion in the loss, as Royal hoed down the Receivers 40-8.

  _results_11_mvp: field_43
  results_11_comment: After slamming a depleted Gold team, the Turtles came into this
    game against the Bricks as heavy favorites.  Jarod, Smiffy and Jason B. all added
    first half TDs as the favorite Turtles went to script in the first half, taking
    a 18-12 lead into halftime.  Marlon had both a sack (really!) and a TD in the
    first half for Maroon.  In the second half, the underdog Maroon squad tighted
    up its defense, allowing only 1 score after halftime (a running TD to QB Jim C.)
    and managed 2 scores of its own to John B. and a running TD to QB Daniel H, as
    the Brick Hard club got its second win in a squeaker 25-24.

  _results_12_mvp: field_43
  results_12_comment: In the last game to go final on the day, Lime took a 12-6 lead
    into halftime with scores from Justin P. and Marcus B.  Josh had all 3 scores
    for Vegas in the loss, as the QB Marvin W.'s XP proved to be the difference.  Lime
    gets back on track.
