  results_0_comment: 'This was a barnburner of a game under the lights of Friday Night
    with two of the Nellies conference best teams going head to head.  It took every
    last play to decide the winner as the Rovers took a 13-7 lead into halftime and
    won the game on the last play, 25-19.  Red had a 19-7 lead in the second half
    with about 15 minutes to play but the Rear Admirals refused to go away.  Navy
    scored with less than a minute to go to tie the game but the Red team was able
    to drive the length of the field thanks to a long catch and run from BB and a
    short TD scamper on the game’s final play from QB Kyle M. for the game winner.  Will
    C. had an INT and a TD and John W. had an INT and 2 TDs for the Admirals in the
    loss.  '

  results_1_comment: The Butch Greens came upon a tough Fuchsia team under the lights,
    going down 30-14 to the Michael J. Fox inspired Fuchsia team.  Jamar W. (happy
    bday!) had a pick 6 in the first half and Jeremy added a TD and a 2pt conversion
    for the Greens in the loss.  Jack and Bill had a TD each in the first half and
    Clay and QB Scott added one of their own in the second half as Fuchsia cruised.  Big
    game coming up next week for the Fuchsia squad.  Orange awaits!

  results_2_comment: 'QB Craig N. threw an INT to Alex P. right out of the gate, but
    little else would go wrong in this one for the Gang, as they would take a 14-7
    lead into halftime off of two QB rushing TDs and finish with a 33 point win, 46-13.  Barry
    had an INT and Jerrell, Howard and Dennis each added receiving touchdowns for
    the Purple team.  Craig finished with 3 rushing TDs and an INT.  For Burnt Orange,
    Jacob W. had both of their scores in the loss. '

    each had a receiving TD to procure this victory.  QB Kyle and Jay A. had White’s

  results_4_comment: A 1 point lead at the half turned into a 9 point victory for
    the Columbia Kilos, who won their 4th game on the season to pull even at .500.  Bugsy
    littered the scoreboard with 4 TDs and 2 XPs for the victorious Kilos, while the

  _results_5_mvp: field_43
  results_5_comment: In a game inspired by Wiz Khalifa (black & yellow, stay up with
    me), the Golden Receivers, thrilled to have their QB back, put up 38 against the
    Black squad, winning by 13.  Miles S. and Baxter B. split 4 first half TDs for
    Gold, while Ryan B. and Santos scored for Black in the first half.  Miles added
    his 3rd TD in the second half while Santos went down swinging (he’s already moved
    to Dallas!) with another TD and an INT in the second half, as Gold won 38-25.

  _results_6_mvp: field_43
  results_6_comment: 'Maroon started off receiving, but they weren''t passive nor
    were they on bottom at the end. Rob C. earned 2 TDs while Marlon D., Daniel H,
    and John B. each had 1 TD in the Brick''s 7 point win against the Boehners.  However,
    Burnt Orange didn''t give up and replied often and hard with TDs of their own:
    Brett C. had 2 TDs, Alex P. had one, and Brendan M. caught 1 another. In addition,
    Howard Chan proved he was a beast and earned his 4th recorded sack of the season.'

  results_7_comment: In the shoot-out between the Queens and Kilos, neither team could
    stop the other's offense until late in the first half.  After receiving the ball,
    Orange drove down with Nikki K. scoring the TD and Billy K. following up with
    the extra point.  Columbia replied with a QB run and extra point by Tyler Lacy,
    while Orange returned with a behind-the-back bobble TD by Patrick K. and another
    extra point by Billy K.  Donald M. thwarted Columbia's second drive with an INT.  Both
    teams stepped up the defense in the second half with INTs by Billy K. and Matt
    C. for the Queens and Nolan L. for Columbia.  B. Stokes and Bill C. had their
    team's respective TDs to end the game 20 - 13, Orange.

    D., Jay M., Robbie L. and Enrique added the other scores for Vegas.  '

  results_9_comment: 'In a matchup of depleted clubs, the Big Squirt Tealers put up
    a League season high 57 points to defeat the Ninja Turtles by 33 points.  Captain
    Smiffy of the Turtles did all he could to keep this one close, scoring all 4 of
    the Turtles TDs.  Meanwhile, the Tealers squirted off points from every direction
    with Chris H. having 4 TDs, Brad G. having 2 TDs and 2 INTs, newcomer Joe M. adding
    a pick 6 and an XP.  John R. (aka the Red Panda), Joe H. and Captain Adam S. all

  results_10_comment: The surprising Brick Hard Maroon team, once looking helpless
    and lurking near the bottom of the Power Rankings, have clawed their way back
    to .500 on the season with a win against the depleted Bluekakke team.  3rd String
    QB Brian D. threw two TDs to Captain Ray in the loss, while Rob C. and John B.
    added two TDs each for the victorious Maroon team as Maroon wins 33-13.

    into half time over the conference leading O-leaf-ia Newton Johns, thanks to a
    TD and XP by Patrick M.  Royal was only able to muster one other score in the
    second half (Stephen T.) while Leaf came up with 2, one by QB Mark H., as Leaf
