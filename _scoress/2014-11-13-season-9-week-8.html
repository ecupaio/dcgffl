  results_0_comment: Chris M. and Mike D. each had a whopping 4 touchdowns for their
    teams. It ultimately came down to defense in this shootout so a combination of
    Brion S. (2 int's) and Sean S. (1 int and 2 second half TD's) gave Columbia Blue
    the victory heading into the playoffs.

  results_1_comment: " It was playoff's atmosphere already in this high stakes match
    up between the top teams in the Nellie's conference. On the line was a number
    one seed and an important double bye this weekend. Orange barely beat out Fuchsia
    to go 8-1 on the season and pushed Fuchsia to 6-3. Jack M. had 3 TD's and Jason
    C. added 3 sacks. Nikki M., Bill C. and Donald M. all had scores for Orange."

  results_3_comment: A battle of the rookie and the veteran QB. John B. had 3 scores
    and Alonzo M. had 1 score for Maroon. Gold had scores from Baxter O., Miles S.
    Marcus S. and Matt P. Experience won this time but Daniel H. has come full circle
    in his rookie season at QB and proved it by throwing the same amount of TD's as
    the veteran Matt P.

  results_4_comment: This was a case of the number 1 scoring office in the league
    going to work.  The Turtles put up 51 points (only the 2nd 50+ point game of the
    season), with Jarod T. having a season's worth of TDs (5) in this one game! Kevin
    K. added 2 TDs and 2 XPs on the day for Dark Green.  Black had scores by Ken G.,

    a #1 seed should.  Captain Scott S. had 3 TDs on the day for Leaf as they emerged
    victorious over the Violets.  Mark H. had an INT, Steve G. had an XP and Ryan
    M. had a sack, all in the win.  Jerrell, Barry and Craig all split the 3 TDs for
    Purple, with Sean G. adding in a 2pt conversion and Howard and Craig coming up

    32-25.  Dameron and Will C. split 4 TDs evenly, while John W. added in his own
    in the victory to propel them to the #2 seed in the Nellies conference.  Meanwhile,
    Lime spread the ball around with Adam M. catching a TD while the couple of Kurt
