    holding off Maroon on the goalline for the last play of the game, as the 9 seed
    advances 20-18.  '

    for Columbia.  Ray W. and Coach G finished up the scoring for Pacific in the second

  results_4_comment: 'The Gays started the playoffs with a bang, as Mike D. and Josh
    E. each had first half pick 6''s, leading 33-0 at one point in the first half.  Royal
    fought back, scoring the final 22 points of the game but it was too little too
    late as Vegas advanced 33-22.  '

  results_9_comment: 'In a rare 2nd round game for a 10 seed, the Bluekakke held their
    own for the first half, down 18-14.  But you can only hold the number 1 scoring
    team in the league for so long, as Dark Green put up 32 total points to move on
    to the Quarterfinals.  '

  results_10_comment: 'In one of their most complete games all season, the Squirts
    led 20-6 at the half with scores by Captain Adam S., QB Brandon W. and Jared L.  The
    second half saw INTs by Jared and Brandon, as they closed out Black''s season
    32-19.  Kyle, Trevor and Cole all scored for Black in the loss. '

  _results_11_mvp: field_43
  results_11_comment: 'Another game that was closer than the final score reflected,
    Navy led the Phite Club 19-18 at the half, with two first half TDs by Dameron.  Navy
    ran away with this on two back to back pick 6''s, one by Will C. and the other
    by John W. to break it open.  AJ, Peter, Tony and Andrew had scores in the loss.  '

  results_12_comment: 'This first half saw absolutely no defense, with a combined
    53 points scored, as the Queens led 33-20.  The second half had 2 touchdowns by
    each team as the Queens kept their title quest alive, heading to the final four
    48-32.  Captain Smiffy had 2 TDs in the loss.  '

  results_13_mvp: Larry Womack (Leaf), Howard Yuan (Purple)
  _results_13_mvp: field_43
  results_13_comment: In a rematch of one of the best games of the regular season,
    which saw Leaf squeak out a win, this one was far from a mirror game.  The Gang
    Violets were playing their 3rd game of the day and it was obvious they were on
    fumes.  Leaf, meanwhile, executed a perfect game plan, as center Steve G. had
    catch after catch and last season's Offensive Player of the Year Larry W. came
    to life with 2 TDs and an INT. Leaf wins going away 31-12.

  results_14_mvp: Sheerod Wilkerson (Navy), Charlie Salem (Teal)
  _results_14_mvp: field_43
  results_14_comment: 'This game got off to a rough start for the Tealers, as they
    took the first possession from their own 2 yard line and QB Brandon W. was sacked
    by Kyle S. for perhaps the league''s first ever playoff safety, giving Navy a
    lead they''d never relinquish.  Navy led 28-12 at the half and never looked back.  John
    W. and Dameron split 6 TDs between then, while Captain Brian G. added one of his
    own in the victory.  Brad and Hobbs each had one TD and Charlie S. had 2 in the
    loss.  '

  _results_15_mvp: field_43
  results_15_comment: Fuchsia's Clay A. kicked off this game with an INT off Gold's
    QB.  But Gold took a 2 point lead into the half, thanks to TDs by Tim, Marcus
    and Miles.  Z, Jack and Bill had Fuchsia's first half scores.  Tim and Miles added
    their second TDs of the second half, as Gold advances to the Final Four, the first
    one QB Matt P. will play in.
