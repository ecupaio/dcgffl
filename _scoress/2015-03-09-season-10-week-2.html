  results_0_comment: The Legion of Doom started Season X off by living up to their
    name, blanking the SkySexuals.  Marvin W. spread the ball around efficiently,
    throwing TDs to Captain Adam S., BB, Robert M and 2 to newcomer James D, while
    running two more in.  New QB Adam M. and the rest of the SkySexuals got off to
    a shaky Season X start but thankfully they don't have to play the Legion of Doom's
    defense every week!

  results_1_comment: The Turnt Orange squad squeaked out a 4 point victory and sent
    the Yellow squad home in time for a Power Fap (see what I did there?).  Jake C.
    had a strong day with 2 TDs for the Burnt Orange team, while the league officially
    welcomed John B. back from San Diego.  He had a TD and 2 XPs to collect the MVP
    for the Turnts.  Bryant B. and Simeon split 4 TDs while Marlon D. surprisingly
    showed up without perfect conditions and collected an INT in the loss.  Turnt
    Orange 32-28.

  _results_2_mvp: field_43
  results_2_comment: 'New QB Nathan gathered in his first victory in the league, putting
    up 26 points and winning by two scores.  Fuchsia''s scorecard was a mirror image
    of itself from the two halves - Tyler F. had a TD while Tyler L. had an INT and
    Ken G. had a sack all in the first half.  In the second half Tyler F. got the
    INT, Tyler L. got the TD and Ken G. collected his second sack.  The BNO team had
    strong production from Jacob W. as he scored 3 TDs; Captain Adrian M. had the
    other TD and Rudy added a second half INT.  '

  _results_3_mvp: field_43
  results_3_comment: 'This game came down to who had possession last, as 0 stops were
    made on either side, the Dark Green Rangers simply ran out of time and the Thots
    held on for a 4 point advantage and a 1-0 record.  Red QB Earl A. looked back
    to form after being out a season with an ACL injury.  He threw 5 tds on the day
    - 2 to Captain Nikki, and one a piece to Long D., Brett C. and Cody G.  Meanwhile,
    Shealy dominated on offense for the Rangers, accounting for 19 of their 26 points
    in the loss. '

  results_4_comment: Season 9 Superbowl runner up QB Sheerod continued his dominating
    ways, throwing 5 TDs and converting on all 5 XPs against the previously unscored
    upon Legion of Doom.  DMitch scored twice, while Porter, Bryan and Sheerod accounted
    for the other 3 scores in the victory.  White got production from Josh R., Marvin
    and Allison with Kip M. grabbing a pick 6 in the loss.

  results_5_comment: 'League veteran turned first time Captain MopTop was victorious
    behind an always reliable Matt P. Turnt Orange made it interesting with scores
    from John B. Sam S. and Meridith B. but ran out of steam in their second matchup
    of the day. '

  results_6_comment: 'Jayme F. and Peter D. kicked-off Teal''s season in the right
    direction by easily handling a Captain-less Maroon team. Last seasons MVP Dameron
    R. picked up right where he left off and Peter D. looked sharp in his return to
    field general. Let''s see if Maroon will fare better with Adam R. back next week. '

  _results_7_mvp: field_43
  results_7_comment: It's not quite St Patty's day yet but the showdown of the Greens
    was an exciting event! Kevin S. and Lime squeezed out a win over the Dark Green
    Rangers. Peter P. takes home this weeks game MVP honors for his team, but no W's.
    How can a Bill C. led team be 0-2? Anything can happen in Season X!

  _results_8_mvp: field_43
  results_8_comment: 'This one was over by half, as the absence-depleted Camo Toes
    were down 24-0 at the break.  Jamar W. had 2 TDs for Vegas in the first half while
    Captain Chris M. and Jared L. each had their own first half TD.  The second half
    was a bit more balanced as each team scored once - Jared gathered his 2nd TD of
    the game for Vegas and Andrew grabbed Camo''s sole score on the day in the loss
    31-6.  '

  results_9_comment: 'The Twerkers grabbed their first victory in the icy lake bowl
    over the Enemies 25-18.  This game saw each team score 3 times a piece yet the
    Twerkers converted on all 3 of their XPs and Captain Jerrell P. ran back one of
    Slate''s conversions for an extra 2 points.  The Slate were down 18-6 in the second
    half but made a game of it, tying the game at 18 all with about 5 minutes to go.  The
    Twerkers drove down and Jerrell grabbed his 2nd TD of the game as the winning
    score.  Larry W. account for 9 of the Twerkers points.  The Slate squad scored
    on two runs from QB Kyle M and a catch from Andy P. on 4th and goal.  Captain
    Kozak had the game''s lone INT in the loss.    '

  _results_10_mvp: field_43
  results_10_comment: The Teal team captured the first score in this contest off a
    score by Jarod T. and an XP conversion by Captain Jayme F.  Silver's Captain Joe
    H. had an INT but the Spooners were unable to convert, ending the first half down
    7-0.   Silver opened the second half with a TD pass from QB John B. to Kevin K.
    and tied the game 7-7. The two teams then traded scores to be at 14 all with very
    little time left.  The Liminators drove the length of the field, running the clock
    down to the final play of the game, where reigning League MVP Dameron R. scored
    the game winner, 20-14.

  results_11_mvp: Clay Arnold (Purple), Mike Cox (Navy)
  _results_11_mvp: field_43
  results_11_comment: Purple and Navy arrived to find a wet field and the Plum Dumpsters
    came out victourious in the sludge-match. Clay A. and Craig N. did just enough
    to defeat an impressive debut for Mike C. and Tyler E. Navy has a lot of fresh
    meat but the ingredients are there for veteran Greg K. to cook up something special
    this season.

  results_12_mvp: Miles Simpson (Royal), Jamar Walker (Vegas)
  _results_12_mvp: field_43
  results_12_comment: This was an early season matchup of undefeated teams, as both
    teams won the first of their doubleheaders.  For Vegas, it was the Jamar W. show
    as he accounted for all 24 of Vegas's points.  For Royal, Miles S. equaled Jamar's
    output with 4 TDs of his own.  The difference in the game was two Royal XP conversions
    - 1 by Linda P. and one by Captain Brendan M, as Royal goes to 2-0 28-24 over
    Navy.
