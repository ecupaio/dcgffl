  results_0_comment: A first half battle between these strong teams left this game
    tied at the half.  Black was playing   without its QB but Rudy B. stepped in for
    a solid performance.  Cody G., Alonzo and Brett pulled   down INT’s for Red. Patrick
    M. answered with an INT for Black. Matty P. maintained her rushing   might with
    a sack.  Alex P crushed with catches, a TD and 2-point conversion.

  results_1_comment: 'A very windy day didn''t prevent an excellent overtime game
    with incredible defensive plays, a last minute tying drive and an OT INT.  The
    Legion of Doom picked off Twerker QB Brandon W. twice (Jim R. and Marvin W.) but
    were unable to hold off Marcus B. and the Twerkers game-tying drive with less
    than a minute to go, as the Twerkers scored the TD and Captain Jerrell added the
    tying 2 point conversion on a broken down play to force overtime.  In the OT,
    Captain Jerrell P. again made a huge play, picking QB Marvin W. off for the 4th
    time on the first play of OT.  Marcus B. had a pick 6 in the victory, as the Twerkers
    doom the Doom 26-20.  '

  results_2_mvp: Mark H. (Camo Grey); Enrique P. (Power Yellow
  _results_2_mvp: field_43
  results_2_comment: A neck-n-neck game by two teams fighting for a respect.  Power
    Yellow blocking wasn’ t, um,   powerful enough to ward off two sacks from Camo
    Grey Captain Kody S. and Braden B. Power   Yellow captain Sean S. answered with
    a sack of his own. Power Yellow QB showed a more   varied game than previous seasons.
    Two TD’s to Enrique and another to genie-out-of-the-bottle   Matt S. put 18 points
    on the board for Power Faps. (What’s this team name?!) Camo Grey had   strong
    showing by Cole. W and Matt M. INT by Mark H. shocks—JUST SHOCKS!—everyone.

  results_3_mvp: Craig N. (Purple); Jarod T. (Teal)
  _results_3_mvp: field_43
  results_3_comment: A dynamic Purple team proved too much for Teal. In first half,
    TD successes were spread among   Howard Y., Clay A., and Brion. QB Craig rushed
    in for another TD.  Howard and Brion pulled   down INT’s. Greg K rattled QB Peter
    D with a sack. Craig N. was the answer to Dameron’s usual   strong performance.
    Teal had big performances out of center Jared T. He impressed with   blocking
    and crazy-impressive 1-handed catch for an extra point conversion. TJ R. put 6
    on the   board for Teal in first half. QB Peter D. rushed in for a TD.

  _results_4_mvp: field_43
  results_4_comment: Scoreboard didn’t reflect the strong performance out of Sky Blue
    for 3/4s of the game. Sky Blue   enjoyed an improved performance—and points on
    the board—by QB Adam M.  QB’s connected   with Captain Kyle B., Eduardo C., and
    AJ D. AJ showed impressive catching and running. On D,   Sky Blue couldn’t be
    ignored. INT’s by Josh E. and Matt G. On Fuschia, Ken F demanded to be   taken
    seriously. He pulled down an extra point conversion, a Pick Six and  yet another
    TD.   Fuschia QB Tyler L. –looking fabulous in shocking pink and ripped shorts—spread
    the ball   around and found Andy L. as a wily teammate with 2 TD’s in the first
    half. QB Tyler L. has   showcased his well-rounded team. Sky Blue Steve Gong reached
    for the, er, sky with an   impressive 3 ½” vertical to catch a big play in the
    middle. He was a reliable go to with smart   routes and good catches.

  results_5_comment: A solid battle between two good teams, as backup QB Rudy L-B
    not only kept his team in this one, putting up 24 points.  He threw TD passes
    to Billy K., Alex P., Patrick M. and Captain Adrian M.  The two stars for the
    Twerkers were Captain Jerrell P., who gathered in 4 TDs (including one that Head
    Ref PMac said reminded him of Odell Beckham's TD) and 1 INT and Mike H., who had
    2 INTs and 1 XP in the game.  The Twerkers win 32-24.

  results_6_comment: The Midas Touchdowns proved again that they’ve got the touch.
    Captain Randy S. outwitted  everyone when he drafted league rookies who know how
    to play gold-touch football. Sheerod   W. continues his strong performance as
    QB. New players Bryan S. and John C. proved size   doesn’t matter when each made
    bigger-than-themselves performances. INT’s and TD’s by both.   D. Mitch wasn’t
    to be ignored on D with 2 INT’s. Lime team QB Dan C. highlighted the talents of   new
    women’s player Michele T. when she put up a 1st half TD. QB Dan scored another
    TD and   Rob C. pulled in the extra point.  Rob C. made impressive showing on
    D.

    Silver in this close battle.  Captain Brendan M. and Miles S. split all 4 of the
    Blues scores while Nolan L. caught 2 TDs and Kevin K. gathered in the other one
    as Silver came up just short 24-18.  Royals Derrick had 2 sacks in the win.  '

  _results_8_mvp: field_43
  results_8_comment: 'Put your money on Vegas Gold.  Chris M.’s Vegas Gold dominated
    this game with a show-me-the-money   performance. QB Scott G. spread the ball
    around and favoring anyone who’s first name starts with a J:    Jamar, Jason  W.,
    Jared L. all cashed in on TD’s. Jason W. wants Vegas Showgirl attention with strong   showing
    on D and brought down an INT with feathers in her uniform. Emory R. added to the
    pile with a   TD. JP did his job as rusher and tallied a sack.  Maroon couldn’t
    recover from numerous INT’s.  Working   out the kinks on O, there weren’t enough  connections
    to put points on the board. Andy A. and Will C.   impressed on D with INT’s.'

  results_9_comment: 'This was a tale of two halves as Slate looked dominant in the
    first half taking a 14-0 lead off scores by QB Kyle M. and Andy P. with XPs by
    Bo B. and Captain Kozak.  But the SkySexuals decided to ''vers it up in the second
    half, roaring back on TDs by Matt G. and QB Adam M.  Captain Kyle B. had Sky''s
    lone XP and Gong had his first (ever?) INT in the loss 14-13.  '

  _results_10_mvp: field_43
  results_10_comment: 'Gold looked dominant once again, proving that they belong near
    the top of the Power Rankings in this rematch of Season 9''s Superbowl QBs.  "Revenge
    is sweet," said Gold''s QB Sheerod W. (or did I just make up that quote?).  Sheerod
    threw 2 TDs each to newcomers Bryan S. and John C. with DMitch grabbing the other
    one.  John C. also added in 2 INTs in the game.  The Rangers  had two scores from
    newcomer Peter P. and 1 from Nix in the loss, 34-19.  '

  results_11_comment: Lime was up 14-13 at the half but down with less than a minute
    to go with Smiffy rescued the Klingons from the Mean Mother Fuchsias on a last
    second TD to win 26-21.  Trey P. (aka LuLu), Ken O. and Tyler L. all had TDs and
    Tyler L. caught 2 INTs in the loss.  Smiffy had 19 of Lime's 26 points, with Jeremy
    S. adding in the other TD and Captain Brian G. grabbing an XP.  Lulu could be
    heard cursing at the sky at the end of this one because he's a Mean Mother FU....

  results_12_mvp: Ken G. (Silver); Jake C. (Burnt Orange)
  _results_12_mvp: field_43
  results_12_comment: 'It was a battle of wills and grit and noisy players.  Neither
    team would surrender in this back-n-forth   duel. Silver team QB barked indecipherable
    audibles that made sense to Kevin K. as he played with a   dynamic force and showed
    his connection with his QB. Andrew M. was the first to put points on the   board
    for Silver. Ken G.—in full volume and full control—snagged catch after catch and
    racked up two   TD’s and two conversions. Nolan L. wasn’t to be ignored as he
    put up a TD hoping the refs wouldn’t   notice his flagrant pass interference later.  He
    thought it was ok to chase a player down the field like he   chases his tricks.
    The rule is the same: Look for the balls. Burnt Orange put newly-returned John
    B. to   work as if it were the ol’ days. They connected on short routes and steadily
    moved the ball. Burnt   Orange Captain Marcus pulled down a TD. QB Jim found an
    ally in Jake C. who knows how to make his   QB shine and put two TD’s on the board
    while slipping through the defense as if he was lubed up head   to toe rushing
    long yards on the way to the end zone.  QB JTrain beat Ken G in the Decibel Dept
    when   shouting at refs.'

  _results_13_mvp: field_43
  results_13_comment: If you were on Navy and you didn't collect an INT in this one,
    you must literally have been Mooning the Hammies during each play.  Levert, Barry
    M., and Captain Greg K. all had an INT and newcomer Mike C. grabbed 2 of his own
    in victory over the Maroon squad.  Oh by the way, Mike C. added 4 TDs as well.  Captain
    AdRob added an INT of his own and Diggy grabbed two in the loss for Maroon with
    Will and Brian D. scoring TDs for Maroon in the loss 25-12.
