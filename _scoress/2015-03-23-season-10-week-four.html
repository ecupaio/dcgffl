  results_0_comment: The Mooners trailed 19-7 at the half but said they'd showed enough
    of their butts and turned it around in the second half almost completing the comeback,
    as the Spooners took the victory by 5.  The Blue Mooners got behind early before
    mounting a strong comeback effort in the second half, but ultimately the Silver
    Spooners emerged victorious by a final score of 27-22.  Navy's MVP QB Tyler E
    powered his way to 2 rush TDs and passed to a wide-open Honeycutt for a third,
    while Barry M secured a couple XPs in heavy traffic. Silver Spooner Andrew M hauled
    in three TDs from quarterback J.B., while clutch 3rd down and late-game receptions
    by MVP Nolan L sealed the deal. Spooner Kevin K made the game's only interception.

  results_1_comment: With Superbowl runner-up QB Sheerod W. out of town, it looked
    as though Gold's unbeaten season would come to an end.  "Not so fast my friend,"
    proclaimed Lee Corso as he put on a mask of the Midas Man.  The Gold team, under
    the direction of newcomer and backup QB (and grinder as the author would later
    learn at Nellie's) Bryan S., the Touchdowns slowed down none, putting up 32 points
    and winning by 20.  Newcomers littered the heck out of Gold's scoresheet with
    John accounting for 18 points and William L. for 7 points.  Andy P. had both of
    Slate's scores in the loss.

  results_2_mvp: Brion S. (Purple), Jason C. (Royal)
  _results_2_mvp: field_43
  results_2_comment: Too afraid to show up, QB Matt P. left his team at the altar
    in this match. Royal captain Jason C took on the job. “Matt may be a better QB
    but I get more tail.”   Purple dominated first half with TD’s from pretty Beiber
    Hotch and—spoiler alert!—Brion. And then Brion scored again. Hotch and QB Craig
    pulled down INT’s in first half. Neiswanger got a speeding ticket on his return.
    Royal was having coffee in the first half but sent in a rusher who snagged a sack.
    “These croissants are delicious” said Captain Mop. “You gays have taught me how
    to appreciate the finer things in life. Pass the mimosa, please.” Coffee kicked
    in for Royal and they showed up in second half with impressive playing and putting
    up 20 points. TD’s to Captain Moptop, and Peter S. Fill-in QB Jason C ran like
    a feral kitty for another. “I thought we had a real, straight threeway bromance”
    said Moptop about QB Matt P and Peter S…”But no.”

  _results_3_mvp: field_43
  results_3_comment: This defensive struggle, which saw an INT returned on an XP conversion,
    another INT at the goal and a goal line stand, saw the Klingons run the clock
    out and beat the previously-unbeaten Twerkers by 4 points.  Marcus B. had 2 INTs,
    one that he ran back for the Power Blue team's only first half points off an XP
    conversion.  Larry W. and Captain Jerrell P. had the scores for the Twerkers.  Smiffy
    scored Lime's first half TD, while newcomer Michelle T. added 2 TDs in the second
    half, the second proving to be the game-winner on a great grab streaking across
    the back of the endzone on a 4th down.  Jeremy S. had a game-changing INT at the
    goal line for Lime, as Lime wins 19-15.

  _results_4_mvp: field_43
  results_4_comment: 'A busy first half in this game came down to a tie of 7 all as
    each team slugged it out on O and D. Burnt Orange scored with Jake C doing his
    slippery routine for an extra point. Mike Z with a sack, but not wig, demanded
    to be noticed. Camo Grey showed its deep roster of talent with Pretty Boy Matt
    M. bringing down a TD and an INT. Not to be upstaged Cole W. pulled down an extra
    point and an INT and followed with “Hey, I’m pretty too.” Another TD in the second
    half for Matt M settled the dispute. “I’m prettier.” Braeden B. and Captain Kody
    hushed Drag Queen Mike Z when each pulled down sacks. The game rallied with Camo
    Grey on top, er. '

  results_5_comment: 'The Faps dominated the Mooners, winning by 20 in this one.  Enrique
    "el jefe" started the scoring off with a nice TD, giving the Faps a 6-0 lead.  QB
    George G. ran the next score in and Marlon D. had a nice back-of-the-endzone catch
    and an XP to give Power Yellow a 20-0 lead.  Supplemental pick Joe C. added the
    Faps'' final score of the half, to carry a 26-0 lead into the break.  The second
    half was all Navy as they won the half 6-0.  Supplemental pick Daniel H. had a
    second half INT as did Tyler E. for Navy, while QB Tyler E. ran in the Mooners
    lone score in the loss 26-6.  '

  results_6_comment: 'Borderline straights—Andy P. and Cody G.—one from each team,  came
    out to play in this sure-n-steady game. Supplemental straight draft pick for Red
    Team,  Mecha  followed with “Hey I’m straight and I’m a girl. A real girl.”  Heather
    Slate Captain managed to pull down a TD in the first half without a call to 911.
    Andy Pratt followed with a TD. Gabe A., in pre-wedding bliss, pulled down an INT.  From
    the Red team, Alonzo snagged an INT and Brett C. put 6 on the board.  For Slate,
    Andy P. continued to impress with great catches and an INT . Judson pulled down
    a TD. QB Kyle has sure-bet receivers on this Slate Team. For Red, Cody G. made
    his QB shine with a TD. QB Earl ran in for an extra point.  '

  _results_7_mvp: field_43
  results_7_comment: The Rangers finally found the right side of the win column despite
    QB Bill C. throwing 2 INTs in this one.  After the game I caught up with Bill
    C.  Here's his quote, "I'm the worst QB in the league; I have no idea how my team
    won this game.  Is there a supplemental QB they can draft."  Uh huh, he really
    said that, riiiiight. ;)  Anyway, Black struggled to find its offense without
    its starting QB, scoring only 13 points in this contest on TDs by Billy and Pesesky.  The
    Rangers scores came at the hands of Yama (2, one a Pick 6), Shealy, and Peter
    P.

  _results_8_mvp: field_43
  results_8_comment: Sky Blue is looking upward. In a close game, Sky Blue went stratospheric
    on Sunday with two wins on a hard-played double-header day.  Sky Blue Captain
    Kyle B. kept his feet on the ground on Sunday as he coached and played his team
    to a turnaround that no-one expected. Kyle put 3 TD’s on the board and QB Adam
    rushed in for a fourth. Lime rallied with solid performance by various players
    including an INT by Captain Brian G. Dennis M. put up a TD in the first half followed
    by Michele with an extra point.  Jeremy S., up to his old tricks, continued to
    make Lime relevant with a strong performance on D. INT in first half and converted
    with a safety slowing the Sky Blue march. Second half,  Lime continued with Jeremy
    S counting up another TD while QB Dan rushed in—no walker on this guy-- for one
    of his own. “Gurl, you know I got that extra point, right?” and then he double-snapped….that’s
    our Smiffy.

  _results_9_mvp: field_43
  results_9_comment: 'According to Teal, this game was determined by the sober refs.
    “When did JJ sober up? He’s a better ref when he’s drunk” came from loudest man
    in the league Dameron. “@#$%@! Ref and #$%@!#!% Ref” from fellow Teal teammate
    Jared T.  Working with a 2-man crew, refs did their best to keep up with a fast
    paced game.  Each team battled for dominance and proved its mettle. Vegas Gold
    looks good on Jared L. and Jamar. Both scored in first half and Jared L added
    an extra point. Teal QB Peter D. was having none of the It-Stays-In Vegas mantra.
    Plucking an INT in the first half and driving down fields and resulting in touchdowns
    to Charlie K. and Jared T. At half: Vegas 14. Teal 12. The battle continues in
    the second half.  Big Bird Scott G in all his feathers, leaps and flies, and oh,
    wait, there’s a sack—and a snap over his head-- on Teal QB. He also rushes in
    for a QB. Teal Captain Jayme led by example by putting up six and QB Peter too.
    Vegas Gold Keith C. made his team proud pulling down one crazy play after another.
    Jared T. on Teal was his usual Top Shelf performer. “No ma’am, I will not be ignored”
    was Dameron’s response delivering another big game. '

  results_10_comment: 'A 1 point game at the half quickly got out of hand for the
    Maroons Over My Hammy who apparently packed it up early to get the Early Bird
    special at Denny''s (see what i did there??!).  The Camo Toes scored the final
    33 points of this contest, thanks to 4 INTs, 2 by Cole and 1 a piece by Charlie
    S. and Hofberg.  Camo''s TDs were thanks to 2 TDs by Cole, 1 TD by Andrew C. and
    2 runs by Hofberg for scores. Maroon''s lone score was by PeePaw.  '

  results_11_comment: Playing as substitute QB, Tyler F wowed. “Dude, it’s like rocky
    mountain high, but we’re, like, dude, in DC aren’t we?” Connecting again and again
    with Will J., they collected TD’s like STD’s. Trey P. impressed with a TD, extra
    point and a sack. Throwing the qb’s flag like it were shade, he said “Pink is
    my color b****.”  Marvin pulled down 2 INTs in first half and connected with Jim
    R for a TD.  White continued fighting as James counted two sacks. Josh R. got
    an INT. Fuschia kept up the fight, defensively, in the second half with Tyler
    F pulling down two INT’s, lucky stars, moons, and unicorns, dude. Ken G said “aw
    shucks” when he got a sack.  Fuschia was just too bright for white.

  _results_12_mvp: field_43
  results_12_comment: Has Sky Blue been hustling us all along? Bruised, black and
    blue, Sky Blue crushed on Black.  Does it take a supplemental pick Gerard to make
    this happen?  Not so fast. Sky Blue made use of players like one-night-stands.
    That one, that one, and that one. TD’s to newbie Jeremy K. (“Hey mom I play with
    gays.”) and supplemental star Gerard (“Hey mom, I am that gay.”) followed by extra
    points to Josh E. Everyone yawned with Billy K. scored another touchdown for Black.  Second
    half was like putting out fire with gasoline as Sky Blue poured it on. Josh E,
    Gerard and Jeremy K (Pick Six thankyouverymuch) made up for a less than stellar
    start of season.  Asian Inspiration Steve G contributed with and extra point and
    solid samarai sword swinging.  Rudy filled in as Q on black but couldn’t get points
    on the board. Ricky M yanked a sack for Black. Don’t be afraid of the gay, Nathan
    F… Black needs you.
