  results_0_comment: In a game overslept by Doom's Brandon B., the White team took
    advantage of a 0 point output by the Rangers in the first half to win this one
    by 12.  Kip M., Captain Strasberg, Allison K. and John R. all recorded sacks on
    Cammas in the 1st half.  The turning point of the game, however, was with White
    leading 6-0 with the Rangers 5 yards away from a tying score when Doomer Jim R.
    stepped in front of a pass and took it to the house for a pick 6.  Jim R. would
    add another TD in the second half as would Josh R.  Dark Green came alive in the
    second half with TDs from Shealy and Yama, but too little too late, as White wins
    26-14.

  results_1_comment: The Liminators rode a first half pick 6 at their own goalline
    by Dameron R. to victory, winning by 18.  Turnt QB Jim C. trying to rush because
    he thought he saw an opening, threw a pass towards Burton but Dameron stepped
    in front and scampered down the sideline for the score.  He would add another
    INT and TD later in the game.  Jarod T. captured 13 points for the Teal squad.  Turnt
    gathered in 3 INTs in the loss - Burton, newcomer Cameron and Sweeney all had
    a takeaway, while Z, Jake C. and Burton had Burnt Orange's scores.

    the Blues, winning 38-29 in this contest.  Tyler E. had a pick 6 and a rushing
    TD in the first half for Navy and Daniel H. also added a 1st half score.  Of particular
    note, DCGFFL Board member Sam B. scored his first league TD, as Navy had it going
    on.  Jason C., Miles S. (x 2) and QB Matt P. added scores for the Varsity Blues
    and MVP Linda P. kept the chains moving down the field in the loss, 38-29.  '

    the lead to 8 with a TD at end of first half by Captain Kyle B.  Josh E. (sky
    blue) and Cody G. (red) also scored in the first half.  Gerard B. "changed the
    game" with a pick-6 early in 2nd half, leading to a back and forth game with 2
    lead changes in final 2 minutes.  Sky captain Kyle B. said, "Hats off to Earl/Red
    for their impressive game winning drive with 45 seconds left," as Long D.''s final
    TD proved to be the winner, 33-28. '

    Friday night, Camo didn''t need the lights to shine bright in this one, winning
    by 21.  As the Spooners Captain Joe H. stated, "silver''s defense couldn''t stop
    camo''s qb from finding whatever receiver he wanted," as Braden (td), Tackney
    (xp), Amanda (td), Matt M. (xp, 2tds), Cole (td & xp), Andrew C. (xp) and Hofberg
    (2tds) got in on the scoring for Camo.  Silver''s TDs were thanks to QB John B.,

  results_5_mvp: George G. (Power Yellow), Will C. (Maroon)
  _results_5_mvp: field_43
  results_5_comment: Power Yellow came out to play on Sunday. A bedazzled first half
    put Power Yellow firmly in control—and looking pretty—with the usual suspects
    putting TD’s on the board. QB George raked up another and Bryant B answered with
    “I won’t be topped, er, on points.” Give him 2 TD’s. There was a collective sideline
    eye-roll when Matt S yanked down an INT. “Oh brother. That one again?” Maroon,
    missing starters for both O and D, tried their darnedest to maintain dignity.
    Andy A reached for the stars on a deep-ball catch in close one-on-one coverage.  With
    ball in hand he added yards—and bling—to the play. Captain Adam scored a long
    TD from a block-n-release with Power Yellow Matt S and George G in pursuit. “Nyah
    nyah nyah” from Adam when putting up the points. Just as the Humane Society arrived
    to put Maroon kittens out of their misery, they rebounded with a respectable second
    half. INT’s from Paul and Will helped their cause. Andy A added hope to the litter
    with a TD. First career TD for Josh S came from a pitch up the middle.  Fortifying
    the defensive efforts, Michelle F and supplemental addition Scott T yanked flags
    off of shifty-hips Matt S. Tony S added another INT to his day for Power Yellow.
    A valiant effort out Maroon still leaves them winless and QB Charlie on suicide
    watch. But don’t kick these kittens…they’re eating Meow Mix and getting ready
    for the next ball of yarn.

  _results_6_mvp: field_43
  results_6_comment: A game that was solidly in the Twerkers column for most of it,
    even being up 24-6 in the second half; but the Mean Mother Fuchsias never stopped
    clawing and fought back to put pressure on the Twerkers late in the game, losing
    only by 6, 31-25.  Newcomer Austin P. was dominating in every facet of the game,
    making circus catches, including an INT and a TD.  QB Tyler L. ran 2 TDs in and
    Trey P. had Fuchsia's other TD.  Larry W. had 2 TDs for Power Blue, while Marcus,
    Adam B. and Bornmann each added 1.  Marcus and QB Brandon had INTs on defense
    in the win.

  results_7_mvp: Jared L. (Vegas Gold), Craig N. (Purple)
  _results_7_mvp: field_43
  results_7_comment: Refs showed up to officiate this hockey game turned fight. Out
    of the box, Vegas Gold drove down the field swiftly and scored with QB connecting
    to Jason W and XP to Jamar. Working with a lean crew, Purple took possession for
    as long as it takes Craig N to drop his pants and swiftly surrendered the ball
    when quiet storm Jared L snagged an INT for Vegas near the red zone and ran in
    for a Pick Six. The game managed to get noisy despite the fact that Ali was nowhere
    to found—NSA Alert—as this Romper Room game got uglier and uglier. Purple regained
    hope as Howard Y snagged his own INT. A steady battle ensued and QB Craig connected
    with Brion for a TD. All players came out of their corners and put on their Romper
    Stompers and marched to field for more fighting. Refs, frustrated and angry with
    the madness of the game, made stern warnings about the chirpiness and the aggressive
    nature of the game. Through his Romper Room Magic Mirror, Ref Paddy Mac, said,
    “Craig N and Chris M and all you bad boys, settle down. Play time is too rough.”
    Shortly thereafter Craig N  flying down the field creating a sonic boom, pitches
    the ball back to teammate Brion, and then does his best freight train collision
    with Vegas Gold Chris M. That’s a wall, not a tunnel. Ejected for 8 plays. Both
    teams warned. Again. Continuing its policy of only using players whose names begin
    with J, Vegas Gold banked on Jamar for 2 more TDs and Jared L had an XP. Jason
    W didn’t look far for an INT thrown directly to him. Purple, unable to play the
    game they wanted, sang B-I-NGO and Bingo was his name-o under the direction of
    Ref Paddy M. Second half scoring by QB Craig and, and redeeming himself, added
    to his stats 2 INTs and a stirring version of Ol’ MacDonald Had a Farm.  Kindergarten
    class adjourned for both teams.

  _results_9_mvp: field_43
  results_9_comment: This game was dominated by the Thots from start to finish, with
    Long D. catching an INT on the opening drive then scoring 2 plays into his first
    drive, as Red never trailed winning 39-20.  Pretty much the whole Thots Squad
    got in on the scoring as Cody G. (xp), Scott K. (td), QB Earl A. (td), Mecha s.
    (sack), Alonzo (2tds, xp, pick 6), Brett C. (xp) and Elon (td) all made huge contributions
    as did David B. for putting pressure on the opposing QB.  The Twerkers were twerked
    out from the first game but Marcus B. did have a huge offensive game, scoring
    19 of Power Blue's 20 points in the loss.

  results_10_comment: Continuing the Romper Room shenanigans, Power Yellow showed
    up for their play-date with Purple and a new crew of chaperons, er, refs.  Each
    team screamed and clawed and fussed in this intense match that finished with a
    victory—and a sippy cup drink-- for Power Yellow. Intense and fast moving, this
    game showcased more O than D.  Power Yellow Captain Sean Stern started the show
    with a TD. Power Yellow QB spread the ball around and scrambled and rolled. Cashing
    in big plays were Marlon D and Bryant B for TD’s. Matt S, checked off another
    INT on his to-do list. George G had to sit in the corner for his wet-britches
    meltdown. “Don’t come back till you change your Pull-Ups and your attitude, young
    man” from Ref Greg K. Down to three plays in the half, Brion, for Purple, runs
    the ball all the way to the candy store from Purple’s own 2 yard line. With only
    one play remaining, Power Yellow says “I want some Jolly Ranchers too!” QB George
    G—wearing fresh Pull-Ups—rushes downfield, does a crazy, cross-field lateral to
    Bryant B who takes it all the way to Sugar Shop. Purple QB did what he could do
    with a lean Purple roster.  Howard Y on the sideline for injury, Purple was unable
    to keep up. Second half, Brion added a QB and Craig N found another INT. Power
    Y Tony S, on the receiving end of things this season, added a TD to his illustrious
    career. Joe C helped Power Yellow with an INT. Marlon D was steady throughout
    the game with TD and XP. Bryant B got his mouth washed out with soap for using
    big-boy words to the Refs.
