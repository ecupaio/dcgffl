  results_0_comment: On a night when Lime was missing some of its star power, starting
    the game with only 7 players, the Legion of Doom took advantage and triumphed
    37-20 under the lights.  BB and Josh R. each had 2 tds and Jim R. and James D.
    added in 1 of their own in White's victory.  Lime's TDs came from Smiffy, Captain
    Brian G. and Shawn N.  John R. had 2 sacks in the victory.  He proclaimed afterwards,
    "I'm the sack king of Friday F'ing Night!"

  results_1_comment: 'Was it strategic that Fuschia jerseys were hard to miss on this
    Friday Night Lights game?  Glowing under the lights, QB Tyler was able to spread
    the ball around—one for you and one for you and one for you—to Andy L, Austin,
    and Trey. Trey showcasing his catching skills, dashed in and out of traffic as
    he moved the ball downfield.  Red Hot Thots weren’t quite lukewarm in this forgettable
    first half. Lauren P showed up to play and added two sacks to her rushing stats.
    But it wasn’t enough pressure to even the game. Red team rusher Ken G added some
    sacks 1-2-3 to his goody bag and earned MVP with his constant pressure.  By the
    half this game, it was clear: Fuschia was too bright for Red.'

  results_2_comment: Royal exploded on FNL for 52 offensive points, winning by 46
    over the Teal squad missing a few players.  QB Matt P. caught an INT for Royal
    on Teal's first offensive play of the game and the rout was on.  Just about everyone
    who played offense for the Royal squad had a TD - Miles S. (x 3), Linda P. (x
    2), Peter S. (x 2), and Jason B. (x 1).  Peter D. had Teal's lone score.  After
    the game Royal Captain Moptop was pissed that he didn't score a TD, threatening
    to bench his QB the next time that happened.

  results_3_comment: In a let down of an offensive game, Royal was unable to match
    its 52 point FNL output just two days prior, scoring only 46 in this one.  Moptop
    thankfully didn't have to bench QB Matt P. because he caught Royal's final TD
    of the weekend.  Peter S (x 2), Clev, Robert B. and Miles S. added the other scores
    for Royal.   Josh S. had Maroon's lone score; he also added in a sack as did Diggy.  Welcome
    back Diggy!  Derek J. added in 2 sacks of his own for Royal and Cody B. added
    in a black eye.  He feels butch now.

  results_4_comment: They may be Silver but they’re playing for gold.  Silver QB John
    B maintained his edge and crazy audible system that produces results. Nolan L.
    came out of nowhere over and over and shined like silver bling. Pulling down INTs
    and tipped balls—4 in all-- he’s a player to watch. Purple, handicapped with a
    sitting QB (Craig N) for the first half, an injured Howard Y, Brion out for the
    season, and Ali on a questionable mission elsewhere proved too harmful for Purple
    to make a respectable showing.  For Silver, little known Andy S was the secret
    weapon sneaking in 3 TD/s. John B spread silver coins—and love--  to newbie Walt
    S and Ken G. Ken G, loud and in full glory, managed to plow over a Purple player.
    But hey, who cares when you’re winning.  A blow out for Silver. Kevin who?

  results_5_comment: Without primary QB, Navy used team darling Daniel H as QB and
    he succeeded in spreading his warn-n-fuzzy love to Captain Greg K, Levert, and
    new-to-the league-but-not-to football Mike C. Touchdowns all in first half. For
    Teal, QB Peter D found his way to the end zone. Touchdown. XP to Chris R.  Tealer
    Tim S pulled down an INT and then put 6 on the board in the second half. But Navy
    had this game wrapped. Newbies to the league, Noah and Chris M put their pressure
    and speed to use. Each pulling down a sack. Barry M showed his vintage talent
    with a TD and Levert followed suit. Mike C add the XP.

  results_6_comment: In a game featuring the bottom two power ranked squads, Burnt
    Orange showed there was considerable distance between 19th and 20th, winning 36-20.  Burton,
    Jake C. Sam S. (x 2) and Mike Z. gathered TDs for the BO team. Diggy, Charlie
    and Andy A. scored for Maroon.  Adam R. made his season debut for QB in the second
    half of this one.  Meredith and Mike Z had INTs for BO with Mike Z's being a pick
    6.  Who knew that girl had some speed?!  Congrats BO.

  results_7_comment: An anticipated game for these two teams determined to take a
    another W to its column. Without its starting QB for the first half, Alex P stepped
    up for his best song and dance.  But he couldn’t choreograph any good moves. Heather
    Slate took advantage of this lopsided first half by spreading the ball everywhere
    and fortifying its efforts. QB Kyle spread love to Andy P, Gabe A, and Bo. As
    defender Kyle M proved why it’s a bad idea to throw anywhere near his side of
    the field. INT for him.  Sequoia didn’t disappoint with her sack. But wait this
    game isn’t over. Enter Black QB Nathan and we have a new game. He used Alex P
    like a fleshlight, firing one shot after another. A TD and XP to Alex P gave new
    life to Black. Followed by a TD to Patrick M and Jacob, Nathan proved he’s a QB
    to watch.  Matt P, up to his usual tricks, snagged another sack. The second half
    battle was respectable for Black, but not enough to win.

  results_8_comment: 'A game matching up the #1 ranked team in undefeated Gold and
    the #4 team in Power Blue turned out to be a game worth watching, as the Blue
    Collar Twerkers ran out the clock to win in this low scoring battle 19-13.  Gold
    was hampered by QB Sheerod W.''s first half ankle sprain on a long run from scrimmage.  He
    stayed in at QB but was unable to move and thus couldn''t play defense.  The game
    was 7-7 at the half with both teams driving each time they had the ball but with
    Gold''s second possession ending in a goalline INT and Blue''s second possession
    ending as time expired at the goal.  In the second half Blue''s defense didn''t
    give up a score until the final 2 minutes.  Porter and Bryan S. had Gold''s TDs
    while Larry W. (x2) and Jerrell had Power Blue''s TDs with Larry, Marcus and Jerrell
    each adding an INT.  Mike H. was MVP for the chain moving catches he had throughout
    the game as undefeated Gold fell to Power Blue.'

  results_9_comment: An anticipated game between two strong armies, Navy and Camo
    went to war. The Battle Of Waterloo ensued as Navy Team put in QB Napolean Daniel
    H as stand-in general. Across enemy line was Goliath Mark H as opposing QB for
    Camo Grey.  Hard to disguise under that camo, he commandeered a strong first half.
    QB Mark scored and then spread the military might to Matt M and Cole W for TD’s.  Amanda
    L pulled down the catch of her career under full coverage.  “Where’s my war glory?
    You gays aren’t the only bitches in town. Move over.”  Refusing to give up ground,
    Napolean QB Daniel shared strategic intel   with Levert  and he marched to a TD.
    Mike C encroached further with an XP. But at half Camo Grey was winning the battle.
    With renewed effort in the second half of this war, Navy came out with new war
    plans, new strategies, artillery, and F-Bombs.  Advancing their campaign, Navy’s
    war chest included TDs by Chris M and Napolean himself.  But Camo was having none
    of it. Secret weapon Vikas—dusted off the sideline shelf—made stealthy moves to
    a TD. Camo waged its war with star soldiers Cole W, Matt M, and Braeden. Mark
    H pulled down a long range missile when he yanked down an INT.  With Napolean
    sidelined for violating International Terms of DCGFFL War, Chris M filled in as
    QB and managed to connect with fellow soldier Mike C for another TD. “You gays
    aren’t the only ones who get to dress up in pretty military outfits. I like a
    man in uniform too.” That from Chris M.  But Camo won this Battle of the Bulge.

  results_10_comment: 'Dark Green found some love this weekend.  QB Bill C, back from
    some unknown vacation to nowhere, decided to prove he still has what it takes.
    “I can still shake my hips and dance down the field. Just watch.” He connected
    with Peter and Yama for a meh first half, but now 12 points on the board. But
    two sacks by Kyle energized the team.  Steve G seemed to be Sky Blue’s only threat
    as he spring-rolled for a TD, INT, and XP.  Second half offered more dynamic events.
    Ryan S for Dark Green said, “Aw Shucks” as he put points on the board. Jack M
    racked up stats with an INT and an XP. Bill C added another INT to the mix. Sky
    Blue found other teammates in the second half when Josh E and Adam S supported
    the teams efforts: TDs for each. But Dark Green had too much for these Sky Blue
    boys.'

  results_11_comment: 'Power Yellow pulled off an improbable win over the #2 ranked
    Vegas Gold squad despite missing 3 of their stars (Simeon, Bryant and Marlon)
    who were off dilly dallying around Africa, California and elsewhere.  Power Yellow''s
    supplemental picks Joe and Brandon led the way, as Joe reeled in 2 TDS and Brandon
    caught an INT in the victory, 25-18.  QB George G. caught 2 INTs as well and Captain
    Sean S. had a TD of his own.  Jason W., Jamar W. and Keith C. had Vegas''s TDs
    in the loss.  Of note, Jamar had this ridiculous one-handed catch behind his body
    on a slant pass.  Javi was nervous he threw his back out making it.  '
