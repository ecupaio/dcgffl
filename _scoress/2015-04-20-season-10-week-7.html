  results_0_comment: It was morphin time for the Green Rangers as they continued their
    run in front of a huge FNL crowd. The Power Rangers relied on a consistent offensive
    attack with Bill C, Sean H, Ryan S and Peter P all lighting up the scoreboard.
    Slate put up plenty of offense too but it was mostly in the 2nd half and was ultimately
    too little too slate.

  results_1_comment: 'Down 7 at the half and 16 in the second half (35-19), one team
    looked to the sky for some intervention and they found it, as the Sky Sexuals
    stormed back to win 37-35 over the #2 ranked Power Blue squad.  Captain Kyle B.
    had 3 TDs, Gerard B. added 2, including the go-ahead score with 3 seconds left,
    and Josh E. had one of his own.  Larry W. and Capt. Jerrell P. each had 2tds in
    the loss, while Bornmann had 1.  This marks 8 straight FNL losses for you-know-who!'

  results_2_comment: This Friday Night Lights game came down to the end, with Navy
    notching another victory 21-18 to pull even on the season at 4-4.  Down by 9 late
    in the second half, Burnt Orange player Sam S. made a ridiculous over-the-shoulder
    grab to get his squad to within 3 points.  But, the Navy crew was able to run
    the clock out with smart clock management for the big V.  Burton and QB Jim C.
    had BO’s other scores.  Meanwhile, Mike C. (x2) and Levert had Navy’s TDs with
    QB Tyler running in the game-deciding 2 point conversion.

  results_3_comment: 'Maroon QB Charlie L: “You don’t bring me flowers.” Maroon Captain
    Adam: “You don’t sing me love songs. Or bring me TD’s. Our bromance is over.”
    This FNL games turned into a solid match with Maroon being led by its Captain
    turned QB. It was their closest match all season with Adam R showing competency
    and smarts while advancing the ball down the field with short attack and crossing
    routes.  Where was the Purple defense?  The points on the board at the end of
    the half didn’t reflect the strong playing from Maroon. Adam R looked comfortable
    zinging the ball at Mike D and Andy A. Purple answered with Craig N snagging two
    INT’s in the first half. “You da fool to throw in my neighborhood.”  Quick costume
    change from D to O, Craig put on his QB outfit—and some dazzle-- as he ran in
    for a TD and connected with Howard Y for another.  Maroon didn’t give up. Maroon
    turned on the lights in the second half.  Adam met success with Andy A and Will
    C as they cashed in for two TD’s. Purple D held strong. Determined to break their
    losing streak, the Plum Dumpsters tightend up and held Maroon to the last two
    plays on the 8 yard line. Clay A proved he’s a reliable teammate on both sides
    of the ball. Great effort all around.'

  results_4_comment: An unlikely turn of events when Randy’s ballet class was adjourned
    for Gold Team when Sheerod pirouetted out of control and fell off pointe and broke
    his leg last weekend.  Fuschia took control of this dance and changed the ending
    of the performance.  Straight teammates were thrown off when the choreography
    was changed. “Why must the gays be the only ones doing ballet?” from Gold stand-in
    QB Bryan. “What about me?” from other straight John C. “Watch me…5,6,7,8…jete,
    jete, pas de bouree, pas de chat.”  In the first of this performance, Gold seemed
    like they were outdancing Fuschia as Big Will and John C did a pas de deux with
    the QB and boureed to the end zone. TDs for both.  But after intermission, Fuschia
    did an allegro while Gold was doing an adagio. The tempo changed as QB Tyler found
    his own dance partners in Tyler F, Trey P, Chris C and Will. They took control
    of this show and danced all around Gold Team’s Dying Swan. The standing ovation
    went to Fuschia for pulling off a remarkable feat. (See Randy S for all ballet
    translations and references.)

  results_5_comment: 'In a game that showed what Royal can do when they are all there,
    Royal notched their 6th win to set up a battle Royale for the 1 seed next week
    with Camo.  And although Derrick J. did not show up in the score sheet, he definitely
    set the tone for the Royal defense, driving QB George G. nuts all day with his
    hard rushes.  Miles S. had 4 TDs on the day while Captain Moptop added Royal’s
    other 2 TDs.  Simeon had Power Yellow’s sole TD in the loss, 42-6.  '

  results_6_comment: The scoreboard just doesn’t always show the whole picture.  In
    an ongoing  tough season Teal showed up for a strong game against one of the league’s
    most solid teams, Camo Grey. Though not many stats to show for itself, Teal was
    polishing its game. Dameron led the effort and said “No ma’am” to Camo Grey QB
    when he pulled down an INT. First half, belonged to Camo Grey as Mark H and Matt
    M twerked up and down the field scattering TD’s and passes.  At the half, Camo
    was in full control at 20-0. Teal wasn’t to be put down. Captain Jayme F and QB
    Peter D turned up the effort. Tim S and Jared chalked up TDs with XP by Dameron
    and TJ mustered up some hope when he pulled down an INT.  Camo stayed cool and
    in control. QB Mark connected with Andrew for A TD. Cole W continued his quest
    for more more more stats; INT and strong playing all around.

  results_7_comment: In a match of two teams with strange team names, Neon Kingon's
    held-on in this marathon and won. Apparently everyone was still hung over from
    Saturday because most of the action came in the second half. Cody on Red and Rob
    on Lime took home team MVP honors, something that they are both getting used to.
    The real question is where will these two teams land in the playoff picture? Week
    8 is going to be so exciting!!!

  results_8_comment: EXTRA POINTS MATTER! Scott G is too much of a veteran to only
    convert one PAT, QB rookie John B on the other hand converted on two of three
    attempts and it proved to be the difference in the 1 point victory over power
    house Vegas gold. Perhaps Vegas' cards are showing and there is a formula to beating
    this stacked team? One more week to tune it up before the playoffs! If you're
    queasy, do yourself a favor and don't look at Kevin K's instagram photo of his
    broken finger, get well soon, but we all know you have 9 other good fingers to
    point at people while screaming on the field!

  results_9_comment: Power Yellow had their four game win streak ended by Royal, but
    picked themselves right back up with a win over Silver (who had just defeated
    heavyweight Vegas?! ANY GIVEN SUNDAY BABY!). It was the second game of a double
    header for both teams so the score was low but Power Yellow fapped just a little
    bit harder towards the end to earn the money shot. Let's see if they can start
    another win streak straight to the DCGFFL Season X championship trophy.

  results_10_comment: "“Surrender Dorothy.” That from  Camo QB Mark H and Captain
    Kody S as they steamrolled over Purple. “I’ll get you my little pretty.” Using
    a bag of tricks that looked like plays borrowed from Purple team JJ’s  plays from
    a previous season, he executed over and over leaving Purple in a field of poppies,
    asleep.  Mark went to the usual cast of characters as he found love with receivers
    Matt M and Cole W over and over. Can we keep Cole off the injured list? He landed
    on the field as if dropped by a tornado… and returned in his ruby red slippers
    and Toto too. “Throw a bucket of water on that witch” from the Purple Captain
    Raul. The Plum Dumpsters were stuck in Kansas as Camo marched down the Yellow
    Brick Road all the way to the Emerald City. Flying Monkey Ali flew in for a TD
    followed by Brian H for another. But Good Witch of the North Mark H had too many
    spells. He spread the magic to Amanda L for a TD and an XP to Daniel H. Nick S
    mounted his broom and flew in for a sack for Dumpsters. “Take that Glenda.”  The
    End. Movie over. Turn up the lights."

  results_11_comment: 'No one was singing Ebony and Ivory in perfect harmony as each
    team was writing its own battle cries. Black QB Nathan F sang love songs to Rudy
    when they put up TD’s. Nathan started with “I’m a little bit country, you’re a
    little bit rock-n-roll.” White team QB Marvin impressed with “Busta Move” as he
    scored a TD, XP and another TD. “Can’t Touch This.” Captain Adam S sang an incoherent
    Jewish folk song . The translation was clear: “I sacked the QB.” Black Captain
    was not to be outdone as he pulled out margaritas, a guitar, and a sombrero for
    the Mexican Bean Dance. White Captain put the pressure on with more rushing. Black
    was rattled.  More music played as White sang up and down the register with TD
    dances to Josh K and Adam S. Jim R’s coda was an XP (while solidly playing all
    game.) Black turned up the music. “I can name that tune in one INT” from Patrick
    M. It was a sing-off show down. But Black just couldn’t finish the song. White
    Team won this Talent Show.'

  results_12_comment: Midas must have (inappropriately) touched every one of these
    men because the whole team is SOLID gold! The team didn't skip a beat without
    QB Sheerod (out with a broken leg). Newcomer Brian S joins the elite list of best
    QB understudies which include legends like Kyle B and Adam R. Now if only someone
    can get him a pair of shorts that don't clash with his gold jersey. In other gold
    news, newcomer Will L finally got to meet his predecessor Scott S at Nellies and
    the world is wondering if they are long lost twins. Red ultimately finished the
    day 0-2 and only have one week to turn things around before the playoffs!
