  results_0_mvp: Jay A (Gold), Patrick M (Black)
  _results_0_mvp: field_43
  results_0_comment: Gold continued their magical touch without QB Sheerod. Black
    has a shaky record but is picked for a lot of upsets in the playoff bracket!

  _results_1_away_team: field_42
  results_1_mvp: Rob C (Lime), Billy K (Black)
  _results_1_mvp: field_43
  results_1_comment: Lime's stingy defense held Black to just 6 points. But these
    are two teams that can go either way next week!

  _results_2_away_team: field_42
  results_2_mvp: Daniel E (Gold), Adam M (Sky)
  _results_2_mvp: field_43
  results_2_comment: Skyblue held in but ultimately fell to the mighty gold team.
    Sky might finally have a full roster for the playoffs and it's a 9 seed to be
    afraid of!

  _results_3_away_team: field_42
  results_3_mvp: Joe H (Silver), Will C (Maroon)
  _results_3_mvp: field_43
  results_3_comment: Another heart breaker for Maroon who has had a less than successful
    season... but I see a disney movie in the making as they tear through the playoffs
    desipte the odds!

  results_4_home_team: '4446'
  _results_4_home_team: field_40

  _results_4_away_team: field_42
  results_4_mvp: Dameron R (Teal), Bryant B (Yellow)
  _results_4_mvp: field_43
  results_4_comment: A tight game featuring two solid teams who can both make some
    noise in the first week of may!
  _results_4_comment: field_44
  results_5_home_team: '4422'
  _results_5_home_team: field_40
  results_5_score: 28-24
  _results_5_score: field_41
  results_5_away_team: '4437'
  _results_5_away_team: field_42
  results_5_mvp: Sam S (Orange), Howard Y (Purple)
  _results_5_mvp: field_43
  results_5_comment: Another nail-biter here as BO takes some positive momentum into
    the playoffs while Purple looks to right the ship after a few losses!
  _results_5_comment: field_44
  results_6_home_team: '933'
  _results_6_home_team: field_40
  results_6_score: 32-13
  _results_6_score: field_41
  results_6_away_team: '4448'
  _results_6_away_team: field_42
  results_6_mvp: Mike C (Navy), Jamar W. (Vegas)
  _results_6_mvp: field_43
  results_6_comment: Navy is getting hot, and just in time! Greg K has this team preped
    and ready for the playoffs. Vegas had a tough time making up for the loss of QB
    Scott G. Jamar W did his best Colin Kapernick impression and Chirs M looked like
    Ben Rothlesberger taking snaps for Vegas.

  _results_7_home_team: field_40
  results_7_score: 33-27

  results_7_away_team: '4421'
  _results_7_away_team: field_42
  results_7_mvp: Jerrel P (Blue), Peter P (Green)
  _results_7_mvp: field_43
  results_7_comment: Two offensive juggernauts went down to the last play with Power
    Blue finishing on top. Both of these teams have championship potential but also
    have some head-scratching losses on the resume. This is will be a playoff rematch
    to keep an eye on sunday!

  _results_8_away_team: field_42
  results_8_mvp: William J (Fuchsia), Patrick K (Slate)
  _results_8_mvp: field_43
  results_8_comment: 'This OT thriller featured a whole lot of scoring as Nikki K
    and her Thots prevailed over the LOD. Lets see what noise these teams can make
    this weekend! '

  results_9_home_team: '4438'
  _results_9_home_team: field_40
  results_9_score: 35-34
  _results_9_score: field_41
  results_9_away_team: '4449'
  _results_9_away_team: field_42
  results_9_mvp: Brett C (Red), Brian J (White)
  _results_9_mvp: field_43
  results_9_comment: Many believe that this game was a preview of the championships...
    Matt P ran over the toes of Camo to a W and a 1 seed in the playoffs. Reigning
    Defensive MVP Mark H failed to intercept anything on D (for once) and that proved
    to be the difference.

  _results_10_mvp: field_43
  results_10_comment: 'BO took full advantage of Vegas'' woe''s and turnt it up!  Jim
    C looked like he was in his 20''s again, so watch out! '

  results_11_mvp: John B (Orange), Emory R (Vegas)
  _results_11_mvp: field_43
  results_11_comment: Despite losing a tough OT match, Veteran Adam S amp'ed his team
    back up to defeat a tough Slate team. Patrick K is in unfamiliar territory having
    to play in the morning matchups of the playoffs!

  _results_12_away_team: field_42
  results_12_mvp: Austin P (Fuchsia), Jack M (Green)
  _results_12_mvp: field_43
  results_12_comment: A close game in the first half turned into a blowout when the
    Ty-Ty connection struck again for Fuchsia. Tyler L is looking mighty impessive
    as Fuchisa is on a roll!

  results_13_mvp: Jim R (White), Bryan G (Slate)
  _results_13_mvp: field_43
  results_13_comment: In an offensive battle, it was newcomer Ausin P aka the Flash
    who came up with a late game pick to force OT and then made the game winning PAT
    to win one of the most intense Double OT games ever at Carter Barron.
