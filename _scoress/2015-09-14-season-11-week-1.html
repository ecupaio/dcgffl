  results_0_comment: 'Titan-sized teams led by Marc Hofberg and Gerard Burley clashed
    in their season openers. Both sides’ defenses were stalwart strong: Hofberg was
    sacked by Leaf’s Matt Hunter and Burley and pressured into an Brian Donohoe interception;
    Graphite’s Rob Casey returned an interception for a touchdown. In the second half,
    Graphite stood taller on Andrew Esquer’s relentless rush, Hofberg’s touchdown
    scramble, and Barry Mauck’s scoring catch. Brandon Benjamin found the endzone
    twice for Leaf. '

  results_1_comment: 'Bottomless Mimosas (Orange), still drinking bottomless mimosas,
    and still pondering their bottom status. The mimosas served them well in the first
    half as they contr olled this game. JP wasted no time reminding everyone that
    he’s a strong rusher. He sacked the scrappy Forest QB Tyler F.  Quick and sly
    as a fox, Tyler couldn’t escape the JP. Another mimosa for you. “No ma’am you
    drunks” as Captain Cormier answered with an INT.  But it didn’t slow down the
    drunken progress of the Bottomless. From newbie Greg C., “What’s with all this
    talk of bottoms and bottomless mimosas? I’m straight.” Immune to the effects of
    chronic gay drinking, newbie, and presumed straight,”  he proved he’s all about
    the game bringing down a TD and an XP in first half. “I don’t want your girly
    drink. Get me a pretty pink cosmo.” QB Kyle M. ( or is it Pendersumpin?) managed
    to add 6 more to the pile. TD for him. “I love this game. What are we playing?”
    from Mike H. on Forest Hump. “This game looks familiar. Is it like checkers?”
    He managed a TD in the first half and again in the second. Will J. threw in some
    love with an XP is the first half for The Humps. But the continued drinking brought
    down the Orange team in the end. While Captain Sparrow was at Carter Barron field
    playing in a tournament of Panties Exchange (or tennis?), his team lost their
    momentum. The Humpers mounted a fight. Coming back in second half, fully lubed
    and wearing no protection, they outperformed Orange. Points on the scoreboard
    by James D, Tyler L. and Mike H. “Yahtzee. And now I crown my checker and call
    your Boardwalk.” Newbie AJ? “He’s a baller and we want to see his balls” from
    Forest Team. Orange’s Jake C. and Greg C managed to show respect in the second
    half but it wasn’t enough. Victory for Forest Hump. Sparrow, get your birdass
    off the court and in the right game. Orange MVP: Jake C. Forest MVP: Mike H.'

  results_2_comment: 'With backup QB and captain Jason Clevenger starting the game
    for #Blacklisted, the Black Offense got off to a quick start with a TD to Bill
    Klitz to tie the game early 6-6.  Injuries to Nikki Kasparek and Bill Klitz took
    the wind out of their sails quickly (Get better soon!) and allowed Glow Your Roll
    to ride MopTop strong, who had 2 more TD’s for the fluorescent team.  Kevin Moran
    and Jim R. both scored in the second half for Black, but it was too little too
    late as Adam Martin had given Lime a comfortable lead by then.  Long, MopTop and
    Mystery Teammate (write legibly refs!) picked off Clev for 3 total interceptions
    and Clev added his own late in the game, but it was not enough as Black suffered
    a devastating start to their season.'

  results_3_comment: 'In the most competitive game of the day, Red prevailed in overtime
    with a 1-point conversion catch by captain, Howard Yuan.  You would have thought
    with all the bodies flying all over the field, each team was using Rockets or
    Bullets respectively to gain an advantage over their opponent.  Silver compiled
    6 sacks on Sheerod and Co., 4 by Marcus Kendrick and 2 by Mike Osorio.  Levert
    racked up more stats in one game than all of last season with 3 TD’s and an INT
    for the Bullets (who may change their name to the Wizards halfway thru the season).  Sheerod
    spread out 5 TD’s to Jared Lucas, Howard, newcomer Billy Buntin and 2 to PJ Tangney
    for the Rockets.  Sparring and spitting, Alex Payne and Drew Halunen maimed everyone
    on the field en route to 2 INT’s and a TD respectively. '

  _results_4_mvp: field_43
  results_4_comment: To Bleach or not to Bleach?  That was the question.  The White
    Team spent the first half milking rookie QB, Andy Pratt with 2 INT’s from Rudy
    Legg Benividas.  Brandon Waggoner capitalized with 2 TD throws to Nolan and another
    to Rudy to go up 19-0, despite Mecha Santos’ consistent pressure, including a
    sack.  Refusing to be a starfish in the second half, the Brown offense started
    to get in a rhythm and move the ball more consistently, but their defense allowed
    The Milk Men to keep on churning with TD’s by Greg K. and John Santanella.  Finally,
    at the end of the game, the TouchBrowns lived up to their namesake with a blazing
    quick TD run by Austin Plier and circus catch conversion by captain, Patrick Kozak
    to avoid being milked dry for the day.

  results_5_comment: The Baby Battles Begin. Freshly changed diapers, these two teams
    woke from a night on the nipple and went to play patty-cake patty-cake. But the
    dominant team came out in the Color Pink. Defying the girl color, Pink was in
    control. Baby Huey QB Matt P. made Playdoh of his opponents. Using Max R, Matt
    P, and Sam C for TD’s in the first half, Pink didn’t need a fresh bottle or bath.
    But Baby Blue was wishing for a new play date. Baby Blue QB Scott G. found his
    new feet (and arm) to reach Staci P. right out of her Pack-n-Play. TD for her.
    Ricardo said, “I want that toy” and yanked off Pink QB flag. Sack. But it wasn’t
    enough. Pink, with pretty bows in their hair, dominated the playground. Walt S
    had two XP and Joe C said, “I made stinky but I also got an XP and and and and
    INT. Are you proud of me mommy?” Pink Team leader Sean S said, “There’s no nap
    time or treats till we win. Do well for Daddy. Call me Daddy.” He led the way
    with his own TD. Along with Michael G and Joe C. Walt and Sam C. both managed
    to yank away the toys with INT’s of their own.” Baby Blue couldn’t muster their
    First Steps in the second half. Captain Jerrell “ I want my mommy and teddy bear.
    This hurts worse than a spankin’. Can I have my binky now?” Everyone go to your
    corner.

  _results_6_mvp: field_43
  results_6_comment: With only 8 players to field for their opening game, Sean Bartel
    put his undefeated quarterback streak on the line against the Peanut Butter Kelly
    Times.  Riding a first half TD to Matt Pesesky, and an INT by Larry Womack, Maroon
    Bitch Get Out Da Way kept things a respectable 14-6 at the half.  Kelly was buoyed
    by TD’s to Sam Smallwood and captain Chris Chernicki.  Kelly came out strong in
    the second half with a run in by QB Marvin Washington and INT’s by Peter Sima
    and newcomer Scott Williams to win the game over a depleted Maroon squad

  results_7_comment: 'After edging out Orange by a leaf in Game 1 of their doubleheader,
    Forest quickly branched above and beyond Lime in Game 2. Four interceptions and
    six touchdowns spread across Tyler Fox, Mike Hess, Will Jackson, AJ Anderson,
    and Garrett Barincoat amounted in a 33-0 halftime score. Lime’s three second-half
    touchdowns -- an interception returned by Brendan McFarland, a run by Adam Martin,
    and a catch by Nick Christiansen -- weren’t enough to uproot Forest’s strong start. '

  results_8_comment: The Urine seemed ready to flow as this game started to go in
    this battle this penis-centric swordfight. Bill C. danced his way to a TD. Golden
    RoDs was having none of it. They needed no Viagra to improve their performance.
    The RoDs, fully throbbing with power, answered with a bigger stick.  The RoDs
    came thrusting back. QB Kyle, ready to top any battle, made good use of Cameron
    B. for a TD followed by an XP to the Famous Strasberg. Newbie O.J. came out to
    fight. Fast on the rush, he shoved into the Power Yellow offensive line with Fire-in-the-Hole
    determination netting a sack and non-stop aggressive sexual assault. He outwitted
    Urine Trouble QB with a quick reaction for an INT on a pitch play. Power Yellow’s
    K. Gostin wasn’t to be extinguished by the stiff threat. Newbie battled over and
    over, play after play, and fought for the ball to the ground in another play.
    Then, INT by Power Yellow newbie Sam S.  “You can’t ignore me.” And then grinned.
    Power Yellow QB said “I can’t hold this any longer “ and threw several more INTs
    over the course of the game. RoD’s straight boy, returning from a season off,
    wasn’t to be ignored. Kyle M. racked up 2 TD’s. With four injured players on the
    sideline for Power Yellow, they were limp. Jacob W. pulled it out when he scored
    for Power Yellow. But Gold penetrated every hole in the Power Yellow plan. Smart
    Gold QB Kyle B. used John C., Cameron, Kyle M. by spraying the ball in every direction.
    XP by DJ made was more proof that Gold is in this to dominate. (Thanks Gold Captain
    Joe for the input.)

  _results_9_mvp: field_43
  results_9_comment: Straight off the manicure, this was a nail-biter. Both teams
    in this colorfield fought for the crown in this game. Captain Porter with veteran
    QB Tony set up the first half with a confident performance. Tony didn’t waste
    time using both Wills (there are two Will C.’s) in the domination of the first
    half. Will C (both of ‘em) were put to good use. Two TD’s for Will C. Tony managed
    to swagger in for 6 of his own. XP (2 point conversion) to Sam. Will snagged an
    INT. Was Purple just hustling them all along? Newbie QB Matt C. said, “You gays
    are pretty but I’m prettier.” He made his own magic by putting Earl to use. Two
    TD’s in the first half for him. XP to Ryan B. But this game isn’t over. “I think
    I’m in love” said QB Tony as he saw the love he was getting from both those Wills.
    Is this a threesome? Purple Captain wasn’t folding. “That Navy is going to sink
    in my drink” from Purple Drank QB. TD’s to Andrew C. and Cody G. XP2 to Jack M
    with all hair and beauty in place. “I love being fabulous and humble.”

  _results_10_mvp: field_43
  results_10_comment: Dueling Br(y/i)ans -- Sanders and Hotchkiss -- were effective
    in their season debuts, marching their offenses downfield and tossing just one
    interception each. But the rookie Sanders excelled in the red zone, running for
    a score, tossing two to Alonzo Mable, and connecting deep with Brett Chambers.
    Matt Murtaugh’s late-game interception lead to the Elite's lone touchdown by Jasmyne
    Johnson.
