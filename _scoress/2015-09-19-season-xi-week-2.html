  results_0_comment: In a battle between our beloved power ranking pundits, Captains
    Patrick Kozak and Donald Mitchell laced it up for our inaugural Friday Night Lights
    game at King Greenleaf Fields.  Interestingly enough, the two of them just shouted
    Power Rankings lines at each other the entire game.  "You can't stop Michelle
    T. you can only hope to contain her!" as she marched into the end zone for the
    game's opening TD.  "Who needs Billy Kramer?" was screamed out as Osorio and Dmitch
    put up 2 more TD's to go up 18-6.  But Brown stormed back led by their staunch
    defense.  Kozak earned 2 sacks and Sam Hewitt earned another to shut our Silver
    in the 2nd half.  Meanwhile, Andy Pratt got into a rhythm and spread 4 TD's to
    Diggy, Austin, Mecha, Newbie Kyle V. and ran one in himself.   "How does team
    twink keep scoring on the pitch play?" Dmitch asked.  Drewtiful earned MVP for
    Silver for a 2nd half INT that should have sealed the game, and also not beating
    anyone up.

  results_1_comment: 'In the DCGFFL’s  inaugural game under the lights at King Greenleaf
    Recreation Center, it was only fitting Chris C.’s Forest Humps were triumphant
    over Clay A’s Purple Drank. Quarterback Tyler F. and Matt C. traded touchdowns
    in the first half: respectively to Garret B. and Mike H.; Jack M. and Andrew C.
    In the second, Forest ran away with three unanswered touchdowns including the
    game’s final to Will J. '

  results_2_comment: Liberal  Elite’s (Power Blue) captain, Sean H said “Let’s act
    like that game didn’t happen. I mean, can we all just be gay and drink and love
    one another and work towards liberal causes?” Perhaps captain. But finish this
    game first. Scoreboard didn’t reflect the challenges that went into this game.  For
    Power Blue, Dennis M managed to pull down an INT in his solid all-around game.
    QB Hotch connected with a few liberal-leaning passes but otherwise felt the strains
    of a tough rush. Kelly’s Captain did his best to referee the game AND play at
    the same time.  Well done Captain. Kelly managed to control the first half but
    fell below its anticipated domination. But slow and steady wins the race was the
    mantra with some help from Power Blue QB. Two INTs were found by Marvelous Marvin
    and another by Sam S. Power Blue had enough D to prevent a complete blow-out.
    By end of half, Kelly had only one TD to Peter S and XP to Sam. Sacks by Sequoia
    and Ryan S. proved they had the control of this game.  Kelly Captain came down
    with his own TD and left the game victorious and injured.

  results_3_comment: Teal Captain Mike Z is coaching up his team in typical fashion.
    “Gurl, you’ll get use to that drag outfit in no time. You need more sass in your
    passing game and more dazzle on the runway.” “You’ll learn to looovvee that wig
    and heels.” “Does this dress make me look fat? ‘’from QB Bryan S. “I think I play
    better in this teal number? Is it my color?” In first half she proved that drag
    queens can play football. She connected with Alonzo Maybelina for 6 and Smiffy
    for an XP. Then in his best heels, QB Bryanna dash in for 6 more and an XP for
    flair. Double snapping over her head with “How was that bitches?” Red Rockets
    seemed unfazed. They blasted off with J. Lucas in the first half putting two TD’s
    and an INT in her purse. Red QB Iman Sheerod sashayed down the field in her usual
    swagger. He delivered more love to Vikas for an XP and PJ followed with six more
    pennies in his clutch. Second half went full throttle as the Red Rockets took
    control. Billy B found two TDs. PJ added some XP love and a little rouge for color.
    The scores kept going. Teal answered with Teriyaki fashion. Two TD’s for her.
    “That’s a drag queen!” “Did my wig intimidate you?” Loudest drag queen in history,
    Ken G put up more fabulousness with his XP and QB Bryanna werked it for 6 more.
    But not enough to outperform the Red Rockets. Project Runway to continue.

    O. starred in Sunday’s showdown, trading touchdowns all morning. Peter’s three
    first half scores and two extra point conversions keyed the team’s 20-7 halftime
    lead. Neither Baxter’s two in the second, nor his quarterback Kyle M’s late interception,
    were enough to undo blues’ first half work. '

  results_5_comment: Whu whu WHUUUTT? Black Teamer Linda P snags an INT from Graphite
    QB Mark H? Move over Andy P. Otherwise this was a mismatched game of strengths.
    The David and Goliath tale was over at that.  Graphite stomped around and wrote
    this story. QB Mark H spread the ball with ease—and style points—to Barry M and
    nearly anyone on Graphite wanting to catch a ball. Barry for 6 followed by XP
    to Rob C. Hofberg in true biblical proportion scored his own 6 and snagged an
    INT and then ate some matzo ball soup. XP to Sam B. After a halftime of loxs and
    bagels and gefilte fish and drinking Manischevitz, the Jewish led invasion kept
    up the unholy march. Second half, frogs and locust besieged Black as  Hofberg
    led his team to the Promise Land and end zone. TDs to Rob C and Dan S. Rob C added
    value with XP and INT. Honberg with another XP. Sacks by Barry M, Andrew E, and
    Sam B ensured that Graphite beat the bejesus out Black. “Who’s that funny man
    dressed in white causing all this traffic? Pope? Is that his name?” from Mark
    H. “Say, who’s the skinny guy on the cross?”

    Kelly Time gimped through the second half of their double header with Teal-or
    Swift. Behind fresh-armed quarterback Brian S, Teal-or scored three first half
    touchdowns to Brett C. and Kevin S: Captain Chris C’s hobbled squad was held scoreless.
    Kelly’s Sam S. notched the team’s lone touchdown. Sacks by quarterback Marvin
    W. and Aras T. weren’t enough to stop Brian from adding second half scores on
    the ground and through the air to Brett.'

    Sherrod W’s tactful attack led to two touchdowns on the ground and to Alex P.
    and Patrick T through the air. Two costly red zone interceptions thrown by Brian
    H. to Jared L. stalled Power Blue comeback drives in the first and second halves.
    Captain Sean H. and Matt M. notched the Liberal Elite’s only two scores. '

  _results_8_mvp: field_43
  results_8_comment: The Slips arrived with all their usual pride and arrogance and
    wearing a pretty shade of pink. “Of course we’ll win.” from Pink QB Matt P. “How
    do I look in this shade of pink?” And to start that victory march, Matt P threw
    an interception by way of a tipped pass. Pink came out shy on players but not
    on might. Ryan S yanked a solid sack for Pink. “I love pink. It’s my favorite
    verb. Yea me. Did you see that?  I got a sack.” Ummhmm. We got it. Matt P redeemed
    his INT with his own scramble for 6. But Lime wasn’t taking the Pink Slip. Two
    TD’s in the first half. One to MopTop and the other to Brad A. Is this an upset?
    Pink responded to newbie Max R with a TD and XP2.  The Power of the Pink proved
    too much for Lime in the second half. With adjustments to D, Pink went for a don’t-look-back
    gusto. Captain Sean S added two INT’s to his stats (as he humbly reminded us.)
    Max R plucked another INT from the less-than-glowing Lime team and then refused
    to stop. TD and XP2. Michael G brought muffins and 6 points to the Pink team and
    Matt S. piled on. That QB Matt sure looks Pretty In Pink. A solid win for Pink
    40-12.

  _results_9_mvp: field_43
  results_9_comment: Maroon moved past the Golden RoD’s all-glow, no-show defense
    in the first half. Quarterback Adam R. drove by Captain Joe H’s defense for two
    early scores. Jason W.’s 2 interception returns amounted to a 19-0 halftime lead.
    The resilient rods, however, polished themselves off and shone bright in the second
    half. Twenty unanswered points on three consecutive drives from Kyle Butts, Adam
    S., and Cameron., including a crucial go-ahead extra point, erased the halftime
    deficit. Persistent pressure from rookie O. J. held Maroon scoreless and a late-game
    interception by Kyle Butts. sealed Gold’s comeback

  results_10_comment: 'Missing their new stud, Wil, Navy struggled early and often
    and Gerard had his best game as a QB (maybe?  No INT''s!?) to earn a blowout victory
    for Leaf.  Tony spread 4 INT''s to Gerard, Clay, Brian D and Trevor in the opposing
    QB effort.  Newbie Christian Smith scored Navy''s opening TD and earned a sack
    to win his first MVP of his career.  On the opposite end, Brian Donohoe ran a
    clinic and had 2 TD''s in the first half en route to his first MVP this season.
    Also scoring for Leaf were Gong, P-Paw and BB.  '

  results_11_comment: In an even more depleted lineup following the win over Lime,
    Pink fought hard in this back and forth battle.  Orange led most of the way, up
    22-14 at half until Pink had scored on their first drive and had a defensive stop
    on the first Orange possession of the second half.  Max Rothschild could not be
    stopped scoring 3 deep plays on the day.  The game came down to the last two minutes
    with Orange leading a methodical drive down the field doing everything right,
    getting out of bounds on short plays and key first downs on 3rd and 4th down.  With
    a minute remaining Orange had made their way to the redzone with two time outs
    remaining and Pink on their heels with only 7 defenders able to play.  With Orange
    able to run over ten plays from the redzone, Pink made a gritty stand preventing
    Orange from scoring through the remaining time and 3 plays at the end of the game
    by putting a ton of pressure on McKinney and solid coverage behind them.

  results_12_comment: It was a battle of the bodily fluids - Milk and Urine and despite
    a lot of blood and tears, neither team seemed passionate about the game's outcome.
    White took down an undermanned Urinal team and broke the seal in the last two
    minutes to make it appear less competitive than the game really was.  The first
    half ended 6-0 White with a breast-fed TD to Nolan.  Each team had the ball twice
    and a lot of clock was drained but both team's encountered shy bladders.  Gabe
    A. and Kieran each came down with INT's.  Brandon ran in a TD in the first possession
    of the 2nd half to go up 2 scores but the Urinals flushed back with TD's to Marlon
    and Kieran to make it 14-12 (Extra points matter).  The Milk Men filled up with
    another TD to Nolan but they couldn't make it a 2 possession game.  With two minutes
    left, Yellow sputtered out in their comeback bid and the Milk Men responded with
    a TD to Miles and a game-finishing pick 6 by Nolan.
