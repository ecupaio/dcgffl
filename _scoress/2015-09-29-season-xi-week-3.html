  results_0_comment: 'Let the games begin with the new Supplemental Players. Dameron
    was there  suited up in Lime. But did both teams decide to sit out the first half?
    Having drinks with the refs? No stats for either team in the first half.  Come
    second half, this game took on a new face. Baxter put up 6 with Captain Sparrow
    following with an XP. Leading the spirit and points to the board for Lime, Dameron
    found 6 in the end zone.  Newbie Greg Kline helped his Orange team with a TD.
    QB Kyle found his own way to the end zone.  Mabray iced the cake when QB Kyle
    connected with him for 2 point conversion. Another 6. But Long D decided  that
    was enough. He pulled an INT down for the Lime team. QB Adam, looking for love
    in all the right places, gave 6 more reasons for Dameron to cheer. Orange wasn’t
    done. We’ve got a game going here. Orange QB Kyle was able to make his captain
    look good. Sparrow put up a TD. An even battle with Orange edging out the win. '

  _results_1_mvp: field_43
  results_1_comment: Kelly came in this game severely undermanned due to injury and
    work conflicts  and struggled against the undefeated Red Rockets.  Sheerod spread
    the ball around with TD's to Vikas, PJ and Jared Lucas - and Sheerod helped his
    own cause with a first possession INT as well as Matt Gander's INT.  Eduardo added
    a sack for the Rockets.  Nothing on the scoreboard for Kelly Green, who's sideline
    was supportive despite the 18-0 opening.  The second half was more even. Alex
    Payne added to the TD receivers, and PJ and Jared adderd two more.  Eduardo and
    Gander pulled in the sacks.  Josh Grossman had his first TD for Kelly, and Marvin,
    carrying the load for the depleted Kelly Team did cartwheels and pirouettes on
    his way into the end zone on a run.   The acrobatics were on display, but it was
    unfortunately in a lost effort.  Kelly falls to 2-2.

  _results_3_mvp: field_43
  results_3_comment: Not much for letting people catch the ball, this defensive game
    only saw one INT all day (by Chris Hobbs), but the ball hit-the-ground aplenty.  Hotchkiss
    ran in a TD to start the scoring of for Power Blue, while Lipovsky and Overbeck
    put the Maroon Swear Words up 12-6 at the half.  An extremely well rested Lipovsky
    added a 2nd half TD to put Maroon clearly in control.  The Liberal Elite was not
    going to go down without a fight.  Tackney added a TD score and at 19-13 the game
    had a chance to be a dogfight.  But unfortunately, it seems as though the Liberal
    Elite had taken too much for granted, not letting no-show Sean Holihan know about
    their deep brewing scandal.  Maroon's familiar progressivism won out as the fans
    on the sideline shook their head and wished they had never fallen in love so much
    with the Elite in the first place.

  _results_4_mvp: field_43
  results_4_comment: What started off as a football game ended up in a rigorous debate
    between two candidates running for new DCGFFL board position, Director of Complaints.  Representing
    Liberal Alabama, Honeycutt donned black and squared off against the staunch conservative
    from North Dakota, Matt Pearce.  The friction on the stage was palpable.  Pearce's
    border control policy was on display as he ran in the game's first TD and fired
    another to Border-Patroller Walter to go up 14-0.  But Honeycutt would not let
    Pearce get away with keeping all the illegals out.  Clevenger answered with his
    own TD and there was life for the Blacklisted.  Stern endorsed the Bison by adding
    a TD of his own and Honeycutt stammered when asked about his Planned Parenthood
    Policy.  Down 24-8, Pearce stumbled, sacked by Thomas Leonard.  Trying to gain
    favor of the refs, he pointed to the Black Captain.  "You can't let her win.  Look
    at that face!" he screamed.  Clevenger calmly answered "I think women all over
    Carter Barron heard what Pearce said."  INT for Clev.  Unfortunately, he wasn't
    able to deliver a final punchline and the half ended.  The second half of the
    debate was very one-sided as Pink was able to uncover some secret e-mails sent
    by Honeycutt from his personal e-mail server.  "Dear Justie-poo.  You're the bestest
    and I love you.  Let's buy a house and never play this mean sport again and live
    happily ever after."  Pick 6 by Capolla.  Walter and Capolla each added another
    TD as Honeycutt floundered on stage.  Honey represented Bama strong and punched
    in two more TD's.  Fellow short-blonde competitor was not going to let a comeback
    bid happen though.  Crazy Uncle Ryan Stitt delivered the final game sealing interception
    and the Pink team runs away with the nomination.

  _results_5_mvp: field_43
  results_5_comment: Oldest League MVP ever?  Brian Donohoe is making his case by
    scoring 2 TD's in the first half against a winless Black Squad.  The addiition
    of Butters didn't allow the team to win its first game, nor did his INT and TD
    in the first half.   Honey threw two of his own, both to Gerard.  Leaf was up
    13-6 at the half and poured it on in the second.   Steve '2 yards at a time' Gong
    added another TD and Derrick had 2 sacks with an INT.  P-Paw keeps racking up
    the stats.  Another TD For him.  Gerard told us all that he throws a lot of interceptions,
    but at least he is fun.  Where is the other half of the deal?  Black can't get
    healthy soon enough, Honey ran in a TD and Anthony and Tom assisted with sacks,
    but the losses are starting to pile up.

  _results_6_mvp: field_43
  results_6_comment: Baby Blue changed their diapers and advanced to training wheels
    in this solid victory over Navy. Neither team could quite wake up from nap time
    as everything seemed to happen in the second half.  Like Bert and Ernie, Baby
    Blue Q Scott and Captain Jerrell said,”Who needs 7 players, we can run the entire
    O by ourselves.”  Counting TD’s in Count Dracula style Jerrell 1,2,3,4 TD’s in
    the first half alone and 1,2 XPs. “Wanna buy a vowel to go with those numbers?”
    Scott added his own 1-2-3-4-5-6 to his counting skills with his own TD. Peter  P
    and Scott sang  “Two of these things are not like the others” as they each pulled
    down INT’s. Navy was as happy as the Grouch when they couldn’t keep pace. TD’s
    to Sam S and XP to Will C gave them a treat from the Cookie Monster. But no milk
    to wash down this defeat. Captain Porter politely yanked a sack and sang “Come
    and Play. Everything’s A-OK.”

  results_7_mvp: Cameron Burrell (Gold), Mecha Santos (Brown)
  _results_7_mvp: field_43
  results_7_comment: Fecal Mattered (or was it extra points?) in this close game where
    Gold erased an early 12-6 deficit to come back and win by 2 points.  The roDs
    started off strong with an INT on the first drive by Kyle Butts, helping his own
    cause. He drove down and pumped a TD pass to Cameron Burrell.  Fueled by another
    stalled drive by Brown, Gold looked fully in control of the game until captain
    Joe chest-bumped a would-be TD pass into opponent Mike D'Ignazio's hands.  The
    tables seemed to turn.  Andy Pratt and his army of Oompa Loompas marched down
    the field and he ran in a TD.  Brown followed up with a stellar defensive stop
    of their own behind sacks by Newbie Evan Binder and consistent threat Mecha.  Andy
    fired his first TD pass of the day to Austin Plier and Brown looked in control
    with a 12-6 halftime lead.  But the roDs erected a comeback.  Kyle Butts, jealous
    of the steam behind Andy's booty, ran in for his own TD and then an XP try.  The
    roDs got familiar with their own sack plan and unleashed Adam Strasberg and Matt
    Barnes on the Prattster to come up with a couple stops of their own.   The Browns
    got the ball back and a TD by Adrian Morales put them up 5 points, but the Browns
    couldn't convert.  Gold drove back and drained the clock doing it, culminating
    in a game winning TD to Cameron as the team remained undefeated.

  _results_8_mvp: field_43
  results_8_comment: Determined to come out for its first win, Urine Trouble showed
    up in big numbers for the first time this season having suffered injuries and
    absences. They added supplemental Jack B to their armory. Maroon had a fire-up
    squad and determined leadership in Captain Justin and QB Adam R. Power Yellow
    QB Jim C kickstarted his new supplemental player with a TD. And newbie Kieran
    put up the XP. But Maroon shrugged. Piling up points in the first half to his
    capable squad, QB Adam, spewed balls to Will L, Larry W, and Justin P twice.  XP’s
    to Justin P, Sean B, and QB Adam danced in for two of his own. Matt P piled on
    more sacks to his collection of stats. How does she do it? Eager to relieve themselves
    QB Jim shook it off and found TD’s in Enrique and Jacob W. Banged up Kieran delivered
    another XP. Feeling some momentum building, Power Yellow went into overtime outperformed
    by 14 points but fired up about their game. In the second half, Urine Trouble
    decided to get serious. QB Jim found his groove and delivered TD’s to Marlon and
    Chris R playing on a banged up foot. Captain JJ delivered an XP. Chris R maintained
    his reputation as sly and reliable with his weekly INT. Kieran put up yet another
    TD. And new Jack wrapped up the strong second half with 6 more.  This game headed
    to OT. Tempers high and efforts strong, both teams fought with loaded guns. Each
    team scored on its drive from the 20. Maroon  took advantage of a penalty and
    scored from the 2 ½ on the XP attempt. The marathon game went to Maroon by 2 in
    double overtime.

  results_9_comment: The battle of the Precious Metals meant Silver polishing up its
    team and coming out against the shiny  Gold.  Old, but not tarnished, Steve A
    put up the first TD for Silver followed by XP to Michelle. Showing bling in his
    skills, John C snagged an INT and added more to his war chest of stats. Cam had
    his own shining moments with two back to back TD’s for Gold. Back in the Silver
    Dept, Captain Donald weighed Gold. Cam and Kyle and John each took six to Ft.
    Knox. Cam, Kip, and Kyle put XP’s around their necks. Levert  J added currency
    to the piggy bank with a TD.  Ounce for ounce, it was respectable of silver, but
    gold came out with all the booty.

  results_11_comment: 'This battle of two top-ranked teams was one of the biggest
    games of the weekend.  Determined to continue their winning streaks, both teams
    lit up the first half with a back-n-forth rally with Graphite eeking out a 1 point
    advantage of 14-13. For Graphite, I’m-too-pretty-just-admire-me Rob C got things
    started for QB Hofberg with a TD. Captain Chris M put up the XP. But out of the
    Forest, Tyler F connected with speedie AJ who dashed through the trees and into
    the end zone. 6 points.  Forest rusher James D pull down a sack on QB Mark. Unphased,QB
    Mark  gave his captain something to yell about—other than the refs—when he put
    six points on the board. Barry M increased the love with an XP. “Dude, this mountain
    climb isn’t over. It takes a lot to get on the top of me,” from QB Tyler. He did
    the hokie-pokie in for 6, turned it all around and went back in for XP.  Move
    over  Chris M, teammate Dan S wants some of the love. TD for him. QB Mark added
    to the heap with six more. Will J helped the Forest fire with his TD and Garrett
    fueled the flame with his XP. Forest fire contained by Graphite: 26-20. But there’s
    something smoldering under there.  '

  results_12_comment: 'Both teams stumbled into each of their double headers building
    on momentum from the first game but also showing the effects of fatigue. Benefitting
    from the sneaky efforts of small people, Austin and Mike D dashed around the field
    like Lilliputians running between legs and under furniture. Both put TD’s on the
    board for Brown. The paramedics were waiting on the sideline with stretcher for
    Captain K.  False alarm as  he managed to get an XP without tearing his labia.
    For Urinators, QB Jim dashed in for a TD and Marlon—actually catching a ball—put
    up six more. “Was I suppose to hold onto that? Or drop it?”  Beserker Sean G came
    to the game bringing lots of love and encouragement for both teams. “I love you.
    And I love you. Let’s have lunch. After I break your @#%! neck.” Called out by
    refs for excessive love, he became enraged as his unrequited romantic advances
    went unanswered. “I’ll make you love me mutherf###er.”  In the second half, Brown
    Q  delivered his own love by using pitch plays and making use of various players
    to take the lead. Ready for some group love, Andy P blew kisses all over the field.
    Yellow Q Jim C shared some love to opposing Captain by throwing an INT directly
    to him. “Here Sweetheart…this is for you, my love.”  Captain K returned the love
    by sacking Yellow Q.  Power Yellow found some love in Jack B. But the lovefest
    was over. Tempers flew, refs shouted, hearts were broken and class rings were
    given back. “Sorry I don’t love you anymore.” This romance is over with Brown
    winning the love affair: 27-18.'

  results_13_comment: Taken out drinking the night before, extremely straight QB Bryan
    Sanders thought he would puke in the opening huddle.  He ended up having his best
    performance as QB to date.  Evading sacks and buying time in the pocket, he spread
    TD's amongst Z, Ken Green, Gary Reboca and Alonzo in the first half.  Steady pressure
    and tempers aflare by Teal rattled the Milk Men who lost their first game of the
    season despite TD's by Nolan, Rudy and Gabe.  Despite an INT by Gabe in the 2nd
    half, the Milk Men couldn't deliver the goods.  Brett Chambers and Alonzo added
    2nd half TD"s and what was supposed to be a close game for standings positioning
    ended up being a blowout.
