  results_0_comment: 'In a battle of 4-1 teams, this Friday Night Light''s game looked
    to be a doozy, but it was not meant to be. The Commissioner poured over these
    two team names for several hours trying to understand what both of them meant
    to try to be funny and cheeky.  Urban Dictionary?? No thank you. Matt Pearce and
    gang came out rolling without their captain and put on the gas with three TDs
    to Joe Cappola and two more to Max Rothschild.  Without BB and Brian Donohoe there
    to help him out, Gerard struggled to get into a groove, other than re-injuring
    newbie Kostyk to the team and bidding him Adieu.  Derrick Johnson was the sole
    shining start for the Trap Greens with a couple of sacks and their lone TD.  '

  results_1_comment: In just the third time in league history, a team forfeitted a
    game due to a shortage of players.  Mercy Rule it is!  Hotchkiss has been known
    to have Friday Night magic before.  Did he miss his best shot at victory this
    season?

  results_2_comment: 'This game seemed to set the tone for a day of hard-fought games.
    This game rallied back-n-forth with O and D and rushing and interceptions all
    playing a role in this good match. Silver Captain DMitch was QB Dan C’s love—and
    target--for the day. Dan had DMitch running routes all over the field and particularly
    effective along the sideline. Teal’s D struggled to make the proper adjustments
    as veteran Dan changed up his plays. DMitch rallied his team to the endzone with
    a TD and XP to follow. But Dan’s new valentine, Drew H, found lots of love of
    his own. Solid catches and rushing yards helped The Silver Situation. Drew H brought
    home a TD. Silver’s Mike O followed with one of his own. Teal QB Bryan S shrugged.
    He met Aaron R for a TD and an XP. Tealor Alonzo M snagged an INT. “That, my friends,
    is why I’m on a travel team. Now watch me twerq.” At the half, Silver was leading
    this match. Teal came back with new focus and drag queen authority as Captain
    Mike Z guided his troops to a stronger second half. “Gurl, use your hips and your
    legs. Like me.” Taking heed, QB Bryan S started dancing down the field by way
    of a smart pitch game stacking up yards like Z’s wigs. Good field placement gave
    Bryan the opportunity to dominant the O for his team. He scored twice, added an
    XP and connected with Alonzo for 6 more. Bryan found his high heels and was on
    the runway in great fabulous form.  Silver connected with Billy K for a TD. Top
    that with an XP2 to DMitch. The game was well balanced. With time running out,
    Silver was advancing the ball, and the clock won. One more play or one more minute
    and this might have been Silver’s game. '

  results_3_comment: Gold put it's undefeated season against a Milk Men squad returning
    captain Miles Simpson the field. White got off to a great 12-0 start buoyed by
    an INT by Greg Kenderdine and Paul G and Nolan TD's but the game was one-sided
    from there.  Kyle Butts led his squad on steady drives down the field and ran
    in a TD and threw another to Cameron. O.J. had his (3rd??!) INT of the season
    rushing making a great athletic play to turn the game around for the roDs.  In
    the 2nd half, Gold kept applying the pressure with 2 more Cameron TD's and another
    by Adam Strasberg.  John Clemons added an INT for good measure and the Gold team
    is 2 weeks away from the league's 2nd ever undefeated regular season!

  results_4_comment: After a tough loss to Gold, White bounced back against the lesser
    metal, the Silver team.  Helping his own cause with an opening drive INT, Brandon
    Waggoner spread TD love to Rudy, Nolan and Stu to go up 20-0. But Silver wasn't
    to be stopped, scoring at the end of the half to DMitch. Mike Osorio added another
    2 TD's in the second half, and Billy Kramer stretched the field but the defense
    couldn't get any stops and the hole was dug too big.  Newcomer Dan Van Roekel
    made the scoreboard for the first time with a headsy pick 6 to put away the game,
    and then scored an offensive TD for good measure.  Rudy added 2 INT's in the White
    victory.

  results_5_comment: 'Teal QB Bryan S was riding a wave from San Diego Gaybowl and
    Hanging 10 on some lessons from Teal’s previous game in the day. Determined to
    prove his team relevant, he figured it out with a confident performance that,
    if nothing else, depended on his ability to dance down the field for enough yards
    to make to Devonta Freeman jealous. But he made good use of all the tools in the
    shed:  TD and XP to Ken G got things started. Gary R, reigniting his best Old
    School performance, put up another TD. QB Bryan swiveled his best hips for an
    XP. Also from the lost-n-found collection was Aaron Y who topped off the half
    with a confident catch for 6 more. Maroon struggled to find the D that could contain
    the Teal Zeal. Dancing out of the pocket all game, Bryan commanded respect. Larry
    W refused to take have a goose egg for the first half by putting up 6 for his
    team. But the lack of defensive might left them at a halftime deficit. True to
    form, Maroon QB Adam R came out in second half with a newfound focus. Maroon captain
    Justin P, challenged his team to put up the fight. Justin led by example with
    rushing and catches. While his Maroon’s D suffered with too much space in the
    middle, they exploited Teal at the same shortcoming. Open in the deep middle,
    QB Robbins found Larry W and supplemental star Dane S with a catch-n-dash to the
    end zone. A controversial pass interference call that wasn’t flagged might have
    meant another 2 points for the XP conversion attempt. Teal Bryan S proved that
    he can do more than dance on O and bars and speakers. He pulled down an INT and
    then scrambled for a TD. XP to Gary for a little more love. Using smarts and help
    from Captain Z, Bryan mastered the pitch-forward-pitch-back method of stacking
    up rushing yards. Another TD for him and another to Ken G. Teal came out ready
    to fight and came out solid winners. Maroon Will L? Come home. Your team needs
    you.'

  results_6_comment: 'Forest struck first in this game on a deep TD to Andy Larson
    (who also scored in the 2nd half).  Mike Hess added an INT before getting injured
    and the Humps went up two scores on a Tyler Fox run in. Will Jackson added another
    first half INT. Baby Blue bounced back, getting two TD''s into Justin Mezetin''s
    hands and Scott Graham added his own INT to keep the game close at 21-14.  Forest
    pulled away in the 2nd half spreading 3 more TD''s to Garret B., James D., and
    Andy Larson.  While Josh Richards and Tyler Lacy (with 2) added TD''s to the board
    for Baby Blue, they could not overcome 2 more INT''s thrown by Scott Graham -
    to Rachel B and another to Will.  Forest marches one step closer to the #1 seed
    in the division.'

  results_7_mvp: Tyler Fox (Forest),  Christian Smith (Navy)
  _results_7_mvp: field_43
  results_7_comment: This love affair between Forest Hump’s Captain Chris C and QB
    Tyler has gotten Chase’s approval. “This truple works as long as you win and keep
    it on the field. You can “score” with Tyler, but that’s it. Only on the field.”
    And that romance continues with Forest Humps dominating this game over Navy. The
    first half seemed fairly balanced with Navy trailing only by a touchdown. TD by
    Navy newbie Christain S put them on the scoreboard. Forest’s first TD went to
    Will with the XP going to Garrett. Then another TD to—wait—Will again. Tyler put
    up the XP. Were they hustling Navy all along? Stick to the land and not the sea,
    and you’ll find a winning team—and a winning season so far—in Forest. The second
    half belonged to the Humpers as they evaded the waterlogged Navy. Is there a foursome
    at hand? Add Will to that truple and it’s a mixed medley. Will crushed with 2
    TDs and an XP. Garrett, owning the center, had 2 more TDs and an XP. QB Tyler
    showed his chops on D with an INT and a TD. Is Navy still out at sea. QB Tony
    connected with Porter and an XP to Jon P. Too many holes to plug on that Navy
    ship and Forest found ‘em. Hump hump hump…Forest did a seek-n-destroy over Navy.

  results_8_comment: Black has won their first game!  They didn't make this one look
    close going up 14-0 in the first half behind a Linda Pratt Pick-6 and offensive
    TD by Clevenger.  Kevin Moran added a 2nd half TD and Honeycuttt ran one in in
    to put the game away.  While Baxter and Cody Barry added 2nd half TD's for Orange,
    they couldn't overcome two more INT's in the second half to Captain / QB pair
    Honeycutt and Clev.  Baxter added an INT of his own in the 2nd half.

  results_9_mvp: Mark Hofberg (Graphite), Wil Coachman (Navy)
  _results_9_mvp: field_43
  results_9_comment: On a day of really good games, this was no exception.  At the
    half, Navy was in the lead despite lots of dropped passes. QB Tony S, in vintage
    form, called the right plays but the players didn’t bring the hands. They brought
    the mimosas. Captain Porter salvaged his teammates’ drops by making some key catches.
    But W. Coachman made it right with a TD. And Tim A sang a lovely song with his
    XP. Graphite QB Mark H took the mic—and the ball—and rushed up and down the scales
    for his own TD. “I can name that tune and it’s called “Six Points.”” Stay Puff
    Dan S added to the chorus of TD’s for Graphite. Navy wasn’t deterred. They answered
    with a TD to Sam S and an XP to Will C. Staying focused on D, Navy pulled down
    an INT to maintain the halftime lead. Was that Tim A singing “I’ll Take You There?”
    The sing-off continued in the second half with both teams stretching their ranges.
    Graphite’s Mark H was a familiar tune. Scoring a TD. Barry chimed in on the tune
    with his on. An XP by Mark H was like a song on a repeat loop. We’ve heard that
    song before. Daniel H brought some harmony to this chorus with an INT. Morse added
    some vocals with an XP. Daniel H? Was that a TD for you? From the Navy team, TD’s
    went to Christian and W. Coachmen with a respectable rendition of “Ebony and Ivory”.
    QB Tony tickled the ivories for an XP. The tune—and the clock—ran out with them
    finishing in a minor key. Graphite takes this sing-along.

  _results_10_mvp: field_43
  results_10_comment: Lime's losing streak continued to 6 straight games with a bitter
    defeat to the Purple Drank.  Matt Cline enjoyed his biggest offensive output of
    the season putting up 47 points across the day, helped by the 4 INT's his defense
    came up with over the course of the day.  Brad Allen had a first half INT and
    Lane Marshall had the lone 1st half TD for Lime.  For Purple - TD's and INT's
    rained like wildfire.  Jack Miles, Ryan Boyle and Patrick Menasco all scored in
    the first half while Jack grabbed 2 INT's as well.  In the second half?  Pretty
    much the same as the first.  QB's traded INT's to each other - Adam and Matt each
    catching one thrown by the other guy.  Jack Miles grabbed his 3rd INT on the day
    and a 2nd TD (HOW DID HE NOT WIN MVP?!).  Earl Armstrong scored 2 TD's in the
    2nd half to seal the blowout.  Dameron and Long Diep scored for Lime, all the
    while asking, "MopTop won't you come play with us?!"

  _results_11_mvp: field_43
  results_11_comment: Black wasn't done yet, going 2-0 on the day and putting target
    marks on a first round bye in the playoffs.  In a physical game, Black rode the
    momentum from their first game to gp 25-14 in the first half behind Honey's 2
    TDs and Butters and Clev TDs.  The offensive outburst was buoyed by 2 INT's in
    the first half by Butters and Honey.... mmmmmmm English Muffins....  While Staci
    and Lacy (Aww isn't that cute) scored in the first half for Baby Blue, the game's
    offensive explosion slowed to a grinding halt in the 2nd half.  Scott Graham ran
    in a 2nd half TD to put the game within 3 points, but neither team was able to
    outwit their opponents defense going scoreless for the rest of the game. Black's
    season is redeemed and Baby Blue has some work to do going into the last two weeks.

  results_12_comment: 'With high octane fuel in their engines, Red Rockets blasted
    off and didn’t look back in this take-it-to-the-stars win. Maroon just ran on
    an empty tank in this lopsided match. QB Sheerod found a star in the constellations
    with Jared L scoring two TD’s and 2 XPs. Howard and his QB Sheerod led their crew
    through orbit with dazzling displays from Alex P and Billy B. Catch a falling
    star in the way of INT’s and you’ve got Vikas, Sheerod, and Billy putting some
    love in their pockets. At the half, they were full throttle with 35 points on
    the board. Maroon was still at the pump filling up a leaky tank managing only
    7 points. Straight off of an oil change and new spark plugs, Vikas managed two
    TD’s in the second half. Alex P added some anti-gravity work of his own and putting
    an XP on the map. For Maroon, Larry W was the lonely astronaut floating around
    on that field. TD for him. At the end of this space odyssey, it was Maroon sitting
    on the launching pad, “Houston, we have a problem.” '

  results_13_comment: In an attempt to cause referee Chris M. to turn to hard drugs
    and alcohol, Kelly Green and Brown engaged in a verbal and physical battle that
    rivaled nothing else we've seen this season.  Insults were issued, curse words
    flowed like whitewater, and Lord's names were taken in vain.  And Football happened
    too!  Kelly led 13-6 at the half behind TD's by Josh G. and Matt Nix.  Our very
    own Sam Smallwood added an INT.  Captain Kozak scored the game's first TD for
    Brown.  In the second half, Sam added a TD to go up 20-6, while Brown mounted
    a comeback.  A TD for newbie Evan Binder and one more by the Cap'n.  The two point
    conversion attempt failed, so the game went back into Kelly's hands and Marvin
    successfully led the team to drain the clock with creative play calling and athleticism
    for Kelly to get back to .500 on the season.
