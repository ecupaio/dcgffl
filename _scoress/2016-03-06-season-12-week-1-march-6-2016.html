  results_0_game-ball: Sam Smallwood (P. Blue); Adam Robbins (Kelly)
  _results_0_game-ball: field_56d46fdeef15a
  results_0_description: 'AKA Inc. took charge, dismembering Barbies limb from limb.
    For Kelly, Adam R. dominated, running in a TD (and XP) of his own he threw a TD
    to Daniel H. and Javi D. Newcomer Greg C impressed in his debut, catching 2 TDs
    an XP and had an INT. Matt P might have been a little rusty in week one as he
    only had one sack. Brain J also added and extra point. Marvin W. was plastic fantastic
    for the Barbies, hitting Sam S. and Marlon D. for one touchdown each and Jamar
    W. for two. '
  _results_0_description: field_44
  results_1_game-ball: Isaac Voehringer (Orange); Keaton Fedak (Red)
  _results_1_game-ball: field_56d46fdeef15a
  results_1_description: 'Just when you think you’re out somehow you get pulled back
    in, isn’t that right Brian S. who came back to QB House Targary-Red and the dragon
    certainly breathed fire all over the mangerines. Isaac V scored his first DCGFFL
    TD on a pass from new QB Ren M. who promptly hit center Dave D, who returns to
    the DCGFFL from a few season on hiatus, for the XP but that’s all the offense
    they could manage for the first half. While House Targary-Red had TD’s from BB
    and the Sparrow himself. Keaton F added a sack to his resume’ going back to last
    season. Red seemed to be on control of the game with second half TDs by Sam C.
    and BB. Ken G kept the mangerines at bay with an INT but eventually the  Mangerines
    offense tried to peel the scales off the Red dragon with a sack by head Mangerine
    Levert and then Cameron B finally showed  up on the stat sheet after he turned
    a short pass from backup QB Levert into an 80 yard TD. Red captain Porter B, not
    to be out done pulled off a nice 80 yrd TD run of his own after a short pass from
    Brian S. However Cameron B didn’t like that and decided to intercept reds xp attempt
    and run it back to give the mangerines the two points. Isaac V added a second
    TD and an INT as he and Cam helped pull the mangerines closer by adding his second
    TD of the day. With Red only leading by one point and Orange looking to steal
    the win Brain S kept Red in the lead with a pick 6. '

  results_2_game-ball: Marcus Kendrick (Navy); Chris Wooley (Olive)
  _results_2_game-ball: field_56d46fdeef15a
  results_2_description: It was a close game between Olive and Navy, with teams scoring
    back and forth in both halves. Smiffy led Olive to three touchdowns in the first,
    accompanied by a fourth from handsome Jack. Tony added an extra point and Stu
    had an awesome interception. The first half for Navy saw two TDs from Brad, an
    extra point from Randy, a sack from Strasberg and an interception and extra point
    from Sanders. The second half for Olive saw a TD from Tony (I’ll get it on camera
    next time!) and a TD and extra point from Jack, as well as Brandon’s second-ever
    sack.  Navy’s second half had a TD from Sanders and two TDs from Marcus (congrats!),
    interceptions by Brad and Baxter, and extra points from Sanders and Baxter.

  results_3_game-ball: Greg Kenderdine (Teal); Scott Williams (Royal)
  _results_3_game-ball: field_56d46fdeef15a
  results_3_description: In a back and forth game, offenses were on a roll and points
    flowed like wine.  For the victorious Royal team, OJ led with 3 TD's and an XP,
    Matt Nix had 2 and Nick Christiansen added the other.  Extra points matter - and
    Scott Williams had 2 which ended up being the difference over Teal.  The difference
    in the game was an INT by OJ in the 2nd half.  Teal scored on all their other
    drives.  2 TD's each for Bryant Burnheimer and Brett Chambers.  Bill Cammas ran
    in a TD and Greg Kenderdine also caught a score.  Down by 1 with time expired,
    Teal elected to go for 2 and the victory as opposed to sending the game to overtime.  The
    final attempt was intercepted by Matt Nix and Jim Connolly ends his regular season
    losing streak in dramatic fashion.

  results_4_game-ball: Cody Barry (Purple); Josh Richards (N. Green)
  _results_4_game-ball: field_56d46fdeef15a
  results_4_description: 'Neyonce’ took over this game like their namesake took over
    a recent half time show. Max R tried to pick up where he left off last season
    and scored two TD’s in the first half each time ZO added the XP after. Austin
    P didn’t want to be left out so he scored a TD in the first half as well. Josh
    R and Tim A each had a sack. Josh wanted more than just a sack so he added an
    INT in the second half as well as a second sack later in the game. Austin P said
    I want more too and added another TD while Dan C added the XP and said I like
    this so he added another XP after he threw a TD to Brian D.  Purple tried to Jam
    It In as much as they could, Will L had a TD and INT in the first half and DCGFFL
    newbie Jordan A added his first TD. But that jam wasn’t going to spread too much
    in the second half as Adam ran in a TD and Jordan A added his second TD. Tough
    loss but really not a bad way to start your DCGFFL career. '

  results_5_game-ball: Chris Butterworth (Sand); Bryan Jones (Graphite)
  _results_5_game-ball: field_56d46fdeef15a
  results_5_description: 'Graphite took the early lead in the first half with a score
    by QB Matt P followed by a stop and a score by Graphite''s Jim R.  Sand caught
    their footing, and came back to exchange scores with MopTop and Butterworth scoring
    for Sand and Jayme scoring for Graphite.  Graphite warned Sand at the halftime
    whistle they had a change in strategy coming. But Sand chose not to isten, keeping
    their head in the sand.  The stellar rush of Bryan J, Rob W and John B took over
    the game, overwhelmed the Sand QB and offensive line, tallying 2 sacks in the
    process; resulting in a second half shut out.  Graphite scored 2 TDs in the half,
    1 more each for Matt P and Jim R.  A tale of two halves, a 1 score game at halftime
    turned into a 32-13 victory for Graphite.  '

  results_6_game-ball: Rob Casey (Sky); Alexandra Harvey (Black)
  _results_6_game-ball: field_56d46fdeef15a
  results_6_description: Derrick J helped black that a** up and blue that back out
    of the sky with 5 sacks in his first half of his first game of the day. I don’t
    think Sheerod has ever been sacked that many times in a game let alone a half
    but he did manage to hit John C for a TD. Blacks offense was only able to muster
    one TD by Andy P in the first half as well. Blacks offense wasn’t much better
    in the second half, again only getting one TD by Dameron but this time Andy ran
    in his XP. Sky blues back issues must have been getting better as the game went
    on because they managed to have two players with ½ a sack each (James D and Paige
    W- how you get half a sack ill never know) and then Sheerod overcame the rush
    and managed to find John C again for a TD and this time he hit Rob C for a 2XP
    that won the game.

  results_7_game-ball: Ryan Boyle (Gold); Barry Mauck (Forest)
  _results_7_game-ball: field_56d46fdeef15a
  results_7_description: 'Forest started off on Defense but that didn’t stop Barry
    M from trying to get on the stat sheet early. On Golds first drive Barry had an
    INT and gave the ball to the Morning Wood offense where Matt C started his stat
    sheet tally by hitting Howard for the games first TD. Matt didn’t want to stop
    playing offense so he picked off Gold again and Gold had no answer for Matts offensive
    attack He continued to rack up stats throughout the game with 5 more TD passes
    to Jason T., Alex P., Barry M.,  Lane M., and Nolan L. Matt C added XP passes
    to Nolan L., Jason T., and Barry M. Matt Finished off his day with a second INT.
    Matts only mis-step was giving up a sack to Golds Binh L. '

  results_8_game-ball: Earl Armstrong (Maroon); Will Jackson (N. Yellow)
  _results_8_game-ball: field_56d46fdeef15a
  results_8_description: 'Chris M’s Maroon Matata and Mike D’s Glow Jobs trade blows
    and scores tic for tat on Sunday. Neon Yellow struck first with the opening half
    only score, a short distance score from Tyler F to Captain Mike D. After a half
    of long, methodical drives to shake off an offseason of rust, both teams came
    out punching in the second half. Brian G snagged a pair of spectacular catches
    on Maroon’s opening drive including a touchdown. Chris Morse added another. But
    Will J and Kip M hauled in long strikes from Tyler F to pull the Glow Jobs ahead.
    Sacks from Evan B and Mike D on Maroon’s final drive sealed the game for Neon
    Yellow. Round One: Glow Jobs. '

  results_9_game-ball: Kyle Veldman (Black); Andy Allen (Sand)
  _results_9_game-ball: field_56d46fdeef15a
  results_9_description: The Sandstorm overcame a tough loss in their first game to
    win the second game of their doubleheader. Rookie Chris B added to his game one
    stats by pulling in his second TD of the day while Sam B added the XP. Andy A
    caught a TD and Chris B added the XP. The second half started with Miles adding
    a TD Andy A added his second TD and MopTop had a TD between two INTs. Although
    Black had the lead at half time with Dameron catching two TDs and an XP along
    with TDs to new girl (and yes its girl not gurl) Alex H. and dirty gurl Justin
    P. They could only black that a** up one more time with a TD to Dameron in the
    second half, losing their second close game of the day. Derrick J had 3 more sacks
    on the day for black bringing his daily yes daily total to 8, what kind of season
    is he going to have!

  results_10_game-ball: Alex Hanson (Graphite); Chris Lucero (Sky)
  _results_10_game-ball: field_56d46fdeef15a
  results_10_description: 'The season''s first matchup of undefeated teams began with
    3 straight scores from Graphite with TDs from veterans BJ B and Sean S and one
    from rookie Colt S.  The defense was bolstered again by a strong rush from Rob
    W and Bryan J.  Sky QB Sheerod W cut the lead to 2 scores with an impressive run
    in the redzone as the half neared an end.  Graphite got the ball back with less
    than 2 minutes to go and put together a drive that was nearly derailed with a
    sack from Sky''s rookie Paige.  Last play heroics from Matt P and an amazing catch
    from Jayme F to end the half.  Sky and Graphite exchanged TD''s throughout the
    second half. Then, the physical toll of a Week 1 doubleheader set in.  Jim R,
    BJ B and Colt added TD''s to Graphite''s total along with an XP from Alex H and
    two more sacks for Rob W.  Sky added another running TD from Sheerod W and a TD
    from Rob C along with 2 XPs.  '

  results_11_game-ball: Rek LeCounte (Silver); Jonathan Amodio (White)
  _results_11_game-ball: field_56d46fdeef15a
  results_11_description: Ken Gaugan’s totally rad socks and Haskell N’s impressive
    impressive rookie quarterbacking debut weren’t enough for the Silverstones on
    Sunday. Despite leading White at the half, the Silverstones came up short against
    veteran QB Mark Hofberg and a team effort by the shorthanded SlayTroopers. Impressive
    on both ends considering that both QB's had just gotten off a plane from overseas!   Joe
    Cappola filled the stat sheet with a TD, PAT, and an INT for Silver and Captain
    Kozak did his best facial expressions (check out the photo gallery!) because anything
    you can do to draw attention to your mouth (not fist) is good. The force was with
    White the second half as they settled into their formation with TD's from Mark,
    Steve Gong and Justin Mezetin and two game changing picks from Justin and Mark.
    Are there questions of Silver turning their mosaic into a finely detailed work
    of art this season? As-if! Of course they will, the night is young!
