  _results_0_game-ball: field_56d46fdeef15a
  results_0_description: 'Bryan S called this navy boat to attention with their first
    TD of the day with Will C following up with the XP.  Gabe A added a TD later in
    the first half. Alicia thought she struck pay dirt with a TD to Joe C  but Navy
    man Baxter O had an INT on the point after attempt and pay dirt turned into just
    dirt as these Silver stones could not dig up another score the rest of the day.
    Navy meanwhile came ashore with with two more TDs in the second half, one by Will
    C and one by Baxter O. Bobby B added an XP after that one.  Adam S. wanted to
    add an INT to close out the game. David P was one of three players in the DCGFFL
    to have three sacks in their game this week. '
  _results_0_description: field_44
  results_1_game-ball: Sean H. (Sand); Mike H. (Purple)
  _results_1_game-ball: field_56d46fdeef15a
  results_1_description: Sand took the first half by storm with an amazing performance
    by Andy A who had two TD’s. While purple wasn’t jamin at all and could only muster
    a couple of sacks by Joe G. However the sand sank quick in the second half and
    were blanked by a purple team who was finally jell-n with a TD and XP by Will
    L. AJ added an INT so that Jordan could score the first of two TDs for the day.
    Jordan also added in and INT after Joe G added his third sack for the day and
    Will L added two other XPs after his D1 players took over the game.  Mike H would
    also like to add that “I had in INT in the game as well”

  results_2_game-ball: BJ B. (Graphite); Zach ((Maroon)
  _results_2_game-ball: field_56d46fdeef15a
  results_2_description: 'Maroona Matata seemed to get lost in the jungle of Graphite
    Content. Graphite QB gave a Warning to “Catch the….ball” to his teammates and
    Jim R payed attention and started the scoring with a TD. Kevin K who usually doesn’t
    listen to any warnings must have been paying attention because he then scored
    a TD of his own. Captain Sean S was so intent to follow his QB’s warning he caught
    the ball from the other teams QB for an INT. Matt P decided to run in the next
    two TDs for Graphite to end the half. They only added one more TD to Jim R but
    they really didn’t need it. Maroon QB Earl A got the lion share of the maroon’s
    stats with their only TD in the first half and an INT in the second half even
    though he was sacked by graphite rusher John B. George G did get on the stat sheet
    for maroon with a TD but it wasn’t enough to win against his former captain. '

  results_3_game-ball: Christine H. (Neon Green); Will J. (Neon Yellow)
  _results_3_game-ball: field_56d46fdeef15a
  results_3_description: 'In the battle of the Neons it was the Yellow who was glowing
    brighter and got the job done. One of QB Tyler F’s favorite targets Will J opened
    the scoring with a TD for the glow jobs. Andy L who took off week one said don’t
    forget about me Tyler I was on your team last season too and was promptly rewarded
    with a TD of his own.  I’m the captain here so I’ll take the 2XP thank you very
    much, said Mike D. Tyler added and INT so he could find Mike D for his own TD
    and let Will add the 2XP this time.  Tyler opened the second half with another
    INT so Brian H could not only get a TD for himself but add his own 2XP and even
    added a sack. Evan B thought he should be on the stat sheet too so he added his
    own sack and Will said enough of this and added another TD for good measure. Neyonce’
    tried to start the game off right with a TD from Dan C to captain ZO with an additional
    XP by Michelle F but could only manage one more TD to Josh R the rest of the first
    half.  Neyonce’ did a little better in the second half with a TD from sliver fox
    Brain D and another TD by Austin P with Brian D adding 2XP wasn’t enough to dance
    away with a win. '
  _results_3_description: field_44
  results_4_game-ball: Craig N. (Gold); Cameron B. (Orange)
  _results_4_game-ball: field_56d46fdeef15a
  results_4_description: 'I don’t think Gold had fun last week but this week they
    surely did on their way to a win over the mangerines. QB Meredith B took over
    after Andrew C gave her the ball by getting and INT on the mangerines first possession.
    She quickly rewarded Andrew by hitting him for Golds first TD of the season. Craig
    N secured the XP and Gold was on the way to a fun day. Orange couldn’t get much
    going on offense and Craig N intercepted a pass to give the ball back to Gold.
    Meredith threw Andrew another TD. Then a nice toss to Clay A. to add the XP.  Craig
    N opened the second half with a TD and Ryan B added an XP. Jason C. who could
    possibly be the reason for the turn-around added his own TD. Craig added his second
    INT and Bihn L added two sacks on the mangerines replacement QB.  Jason found
    his way to the end zone for his second TD with Rachel B adding the XP. '

  results_5_game-ball: Ricky J. (Forest); Steve G. (White)
  _results_5_game-ball: field_56d46fdeef15a
  results_5_description: The Slaytroopers navigated through the forest in a toe-to-toe
    game. Mark Hofberg was all over the place again with 4 TD's, 1 rush TD, 3 rush
    PAT's, and a whopping 5 picks on defense! That got white out of the Morning Woods
    which had TD's from 3 different players and big rush all-day with Ricky.

  results_6_game-ball: Porter B. (Red); Bryant B. (Teal)
  _results_6_game-ball: field_56d46fdeef15a
  results_6_description: Congratulations on your first DCGFFL TD Keaton F. You accounted
    for all the scoring for your team in the first half. Unfortunately, the coin toss
    for this game came up teal. They had first half TD scores by Bill C and D-Mitch.
    While Bryant B added an INT and Sequoia H and Drew H (no relation) each added
    a sack. Teal went into half time with a 6 point lead. With BB adding a TD and
    Porter B and James B (again no relation) each added a sack, Red looked to slay
    their opponent in this close game. Someone must have used a two teals coin. Much
    like the first half teal did just enough to keep the game in their favor. Bryant
    B scored a second half TD for teal while Greg K added the XP that turned out to
    be the deciding point. Red tried to claw their way back into the game with a TD
    score by Sam C. However those elusive XPs let teal slay the dragon as D-Mitch
    came up with an INT to seal the win.

  results_7_game-ball: Alex A. (Power Blue);  Matt G. (Sky Blue)
  _results_7_game-ball: field_56d46fdeef15a
  results_7_description: " The Power was up in the Sky with this game as the two blues
    battled back and forth for most of the game. The Handsome Ken doll on the barbies,
    Nick B, helped get them on the scoreboard with his first DCGFFL TD with an XP
    by the old soldier Marlon D. Marvin W wanted the ball back on offense so he decided
    to get an INT while on defense so he could find the other old soldier Sam S. for
    a TD.  While Alex A added a sack and Marlon D thought he should get his own INT.
    \ Marvin W scored his own TD in the second half and then tossed another one to
    Marlon D….Soldier on.  As much as sky tried stay in touch with the power in the
    first have with a TD by John C and XP by Matt G.  and a sack by James D. they
    even tried to keep up into the second half with Sheerod W scoring a TD and XP
    and then finding John C again for a TD and Matt G again for the XP their back
    finally went out and couldn’t keep the power."

  results_8_game-ball: Charlie S. (Royal); Michelle D. (Olive)
  _results_8_game-ball: field_56d46fdeef15a
  results_8_description: It might be too early to knight this royal player “Sir OJ”
    but he scored in impressive fashion with three TDs, two on long bombs and one
    weaving through the defense. Two of which in the first half and one in the second
    half along with a second half XP. One who truly deserves the title of “Sir Charlie”
    (he has an award named after him after all) also scored in the second half for
    Royal. But this Battle tested team couldn’t hold their alcohol, at least not Martini’s.This
    was the perfect Olive for the drink as QB Brandon W worked with another HOFer
    Tony S for a TD and two XP’s, one in each half. Smiffy had two TDs and an INT
    in the first half and added an INT in the second half. Jack M had his own INT
    in the first half. QB Brandon W ran in a TD of his own late in the second half.

  results_9_game-ball: Jeff W. (White); Steve T. (Teal)
  _results_9_game-ball: field_56d46fdeef15a
  results_9_description: ' This game was a coin toss and it at the end of the long
    slay, it landed on Teals. In a game featuring two of the most athletic QB''s in
    the league, Bill C came out on top by spreading the wealth with 5TD''s to 4 different
    recievers. A young scrappy and hungry Captian Larry Womack did his best with 2TD''s
    and 1 INT, but the troopers came up just one "pew-pew" too short. It came down
    to the last play... with White on their heels, Teal sealed the deal despite an
    Appeal. Fo'' Real. '

  results_10_game-ball: James B. (Red); Alex P. (Forest)
  _results_10_game-ball: field_56d46fdeef15a
  results_10_description: The Dragon of House Targary-Red had obviously never experienced
    morning wood before and it was stuck in the forest all day. With  Ryan getting
    a sack in the first half and Porter B, Lynnette C (with her first in the DCGFFL)
    and Sam C all scoring TDs. Then BB scoring a TD in the second half didn’t help
    them fight through the trees. The Woods were too thick, with scoring. Two First
    half TDs by the biggest wood Nolan L. who added a third in the second half. Wood
    captain Howard scored an XP in the first half and a TD in the second while Ricky
    J had a sack in the first half. Kieth C had a TD in the second half while Alex
    P had and INT and Barry M had a sack while playing with his wood.

  results_11_game-ball: Braden B. (Kelly); Scott G. (Black)
  _results_11_game-ball: field_56d46fdeef15a
  results_11_description: Alpha Kelly Alpha struggled in the first half with only
    one TD by QB Adam R. Luckily Black couldn’t get that ass into the end zone more
    than once themselves with a TD by Andy P but they did get their XP by Scott G
    (heal up buddy, rest the ankle). Sadly the Justin P was the only ass that could
    back up into the end zone in the second half. Derrick J worked his ass off today
    though adding three more sacks to his total after he was challenged by someone
    who said he might not be the best rusher in the league. While the corporation
    worked the whole game and in the second half they had Greg C who is slowly making
    a name for himself in the DCGFFL with two TDs and an INT. Already well known Coach
    G scored a TD as well. Adam R scored and XP and Bobby H scored a TD as well while
    Braden B added two sacks of his own.
