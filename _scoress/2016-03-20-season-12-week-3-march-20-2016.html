  results_0_description: 'Daylight proved hard Sky to find on Sunday: Blue only managed
    a sack by Mecha S in the first half. Jens P serving as QB briefly peaked out from
    behind the clouds in the second. He found Chris R and Matt G for TDs. But the
    sandstorm proved to be too much for him to see through. QB Long D not only ran
    in a TD, he threw TD passes Brendan M and Jason R. Brendan M also had an XP along
    with Chris L. Sean H added an INT while Eduardo C had a sack.'

  results_2_description: 'The seafaring Boaties navigated dutifully through the Forest
    on Sunday. Green’s Nolan L and Alex P each had TDs and Keith C added an XP, Barry
    M helped with a sack. Alas, the Woods weren’t tall enough to stop the Boaties
    as Bryan S found Will C for 3 TDs. He also found Gabe A. for 1 TD, and Aaron R.,
    Brad A., and Baxter O. for XPs. He and Will C. also grabbed INTs. '

  results_3_game-ball: Jen J. (White); OJ (Royal)
  _results_3_game-ball: field_56d46fdeef15a
  results_3_description: 5 minutes before kick-off, Royal only had 5 palyers and both
    teams were already thinking about getting out of the cold and going to brunch.
    Then in the distance Matt Fransien was seen racing towards Carter Barron and Royal
    had just enough to play (six), albiet with a less than 100% Jeremey Steslicki
    who was making an early return from last years knee injury. He must have had the
    same doctors as Adrian Peterson because Jeremey did not skip a beat. With every
    catch, dive, and slip in the mud spectators watched in awe (and a little bit of
    fear). The Slaytroopers were thinking about the mimosas a little too soon becuase
    before they knew it, Royal was leading at halftime! Both offenses were clicking
    as it turned into a classic shoot out of smart short-game and home-run football.
    At the end of the day White knew what they had to do if they wanted to win the
    game, and that was stop the trainwreck! Late in the game, Mark Hofberg came up
    with a huge interception then drive to take take the lead and then newcomer Jen
    Jones sealed the win with a game ending interception of her own!

  results_5_description: Billy K’s shook and stirred House TargaryRed in Season XII
    debut, scoring 2 XPs, nabbing 1 INT and 1 TD. While Smiffy had a TD and an 2 INTs,
    and Jack M had one INT. Stu S and Brandon W both had TDs as well. Captain Porter
    S. and his House -- of the mightiest winos in Westeros -- couldn’t handle their
    the strength of Olive’s martinis. They only managed TDs by Christian S and Sam
    C. and two sacks by Tom L.

  _results_6_game-ball: field_56d46fdeef15a
  results_6_description: AKA’s Illustrious ladies’ showed off their finest in Sunday’s
    mixer with Jam It In’s gentlemen. Kelly’s QB, Adam R, grabbed INT from Purple’s
    Adam M. Captain Josh E scored an early a TD, but Coach G was the star of this
    show with 3 TDs and an XP.  Impressive as Kelly looked, Purple stole the show.
    Jordan A had an impressive game with 3 INTs, 2TDs and an XP. Will L added a TD
    and XP. While Mike H had a TD and AJ found the end zone for and XP. Adam M made
    it look easy as he not only threw those TD passes but he ran in for 3 TDs of his
    own.

  results_7_description: 'The Barbies welcomed to Maroon to their Dream House for
    brunch on Sunday. Gracious hosts, they were not. Marvin W not only had an INT
    but also scored 2 TD and an XP while finding Jamar W for three TDs and an XP,
    while Sam S had a TD. Andrew E. added an INT. Maroon was only offered one TD by
    Chris M, an INT by Earl A., and a mimosa that was mostly orange juice. '

  results_8_game-ball: Pete G. (Orange); Mike A. (Teal)
  _results_8_game-ball: field_56d46fdeef15a
  results_8_description: Orange hoped for a win after last week’s shutout from Gold,
    but they weren’t successful even with their primary QB, Ren McKinnon, back from
    the disabled list.  Teal kicked off to start the game, but Orange missed catches
    and turned over the ball on downs in their own territory.  Teal’s Drew Halunen
    scored shortly after and was backed up by an extra point from Bryan Burnheimer.  Orange’s
    second drive was stopped short when Bill Cammas intercepted a bounce-off after
    Sam Brown failed to catch the football with his face.  For the rest of the half,
    Orange’s receivers could not catch nor could their defense stop Burnheimer (x2)
    and Brett Chambers from scoring TDs.  Donald Mitchell and Cammas punched in extra
    points to make the score 27-0 at the half.  In the second half, Orange finally
    started to click.  Ren spread the ball around to Dave Davis, Isaac Voehringer,
    Sean Karson, Peter Gately, Brown, and Levert James (who scored both of Orange’s
    TDs). Meanwhile, Orange’s defense made Teal work hard to move the ball down the
    field and held them to 2 TDs (by Bill and Donald).  Overall, Orange showed promise
    in the second half, but Teal’s experience and discipline dominated the first 30
    minutes of the game.

  _results_9_game-ball: field_56d46fdeef15a
  results_9_description: 'The Silverstones left the scoreboard shining in their first
    game on Sunday. Unfortunately their luster wore off the second of their doubleheader.
    After hanging 40 on Gold, Silver could only muster 1 Joe C  TD against Olive.
    Brian added 1 INT and Kozak and Joe C each had sacks. Making a stunning entrance
    to the Dirty Martini’s Cocktail Party, Billy K. wowed with 2 INTs, 2 TDs, and
    a dazzling designer knee-brace. Stu S added 3 TDs. Captain Kevin S. and Jack each
    added XPs. '

  _results_10_game-ball: field_56d46fdeef15a
  results_10_description: Adam M tried to jam it in again in the second game of Purple’s
    double header. He stuck TD passes to the hands of AJ, Mike, Will L, and Jordan
    A. Mike H and AJ both had INTs as well and AJ had an XP. Earl A., too slippery
    for Jam, led Maroon though in their second game of the day. TD passes to Mike
    Z (3), Billy L, and Chris M and INT’s by Jason B and Earl A sealed the win for
    Maroona Matata.

  results_11_game-ball: BJ B. (Graphite); Daniel L. (Neon Green)
  _results_11_game-ball: field_56d46fdeef15a
  results_11_description: Colt S. did a great job filling in as QB for Graphite, connecting
    with Kevin K. (2), Alex H., and B.J for touchdowns. Alex, BJ and Sean S. grabbed
    extra points. Colt also helped his cause on defense, nabbing an INT. Neon Green,
    fielding its full roster with regular QB, Dan C., played at full strength. Dan
    threw TDs to Josh R, Max R (3) and Michelle F. While Austin P caught two XPs to
    hand graphite their first loss of the season. Alonzo M. had a sack in the win.
