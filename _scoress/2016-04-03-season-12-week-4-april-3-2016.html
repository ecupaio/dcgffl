  _results_0_game-ball: field_56d46fdeef15a
  results_0_description: 'Graphite, down two reliable receivers, counted on Jim Roll
    and BJ Bundy to lead their offense. They both scored touchdowns; Sean Stern scored
    two extra points. But it wasn’t enough to overcome Marvin’s two running touchdowns
    and Marlon’s through the air, handing reigning-championship quarterback Matt Pearce
    his second loss of the season. '

  _results_1_game-ball: field_56d46fdeef15a
  results_1_description: 'George Garner, filling in Earl Armstrong’s pocket, connected
    with Brian Golden, Billy Lechert, and Mike ZGoda for scores in Maroon’s win. Neyoncé’s
    Captain Alonzo and Andy Merterns did their best to spoil the backup’s Season XII
    debut, picking off Garner three times. But their touchdowns, Max Rothschild’s
    pair, and Dan Cipullo’s fell short. '
  _results_1_description: field_44
  results_2_game-ball: Kirk Y. (Silver); Mike A. (Teal)
  _results_2_game-ball: field_56d46fdeef15a
  results_2_description: 'Teal eeked out a win over Silver behind Drew Halunen’s two
    touchdowns and scores from Bryant and Brett. Cammas and Kenderdine claimed three
    extra points.  Kozak snagged two touchdowns in the loss, including one acrobatic
    end zone grab. '

  results_3_game-ball: Matt P. (Kelly); Jens P. (Sky Blue)
  _results_3_game-ball: field_56d46fdeef15a
  results_3_description: 'Sky’s Sherrod got back to his winning ways, finding Matt
    Gander and Rob Casey twice for touchdowns and Adam Robbins in Kelly’s backfield
    for a sack. Alpha’s day belonged to Greg Carter, who hauled in two scores, two
    extra points, and an interception. He was not to be outdone by Matt Peseskey,
    who added a touchdown and a sack of his own. '

  _results_4_game-ball: field_56d46fdeef15a
  results_4_description: The high winds didn't keep these two potent offenses from
    filling up the stat sheet. Eveuntally Red prevailed with a one score lead as White
    ran out of gas without their Queen Bee Captian Larry Womack. Brian Sparrow sliced
    and diced all day with his numerous weapons, leading the well oiled offense against
    a (usually) tough Mark Hoffberg-led defense. Michele Ta-a scored two TD's and
    a PAT. and Brandon Benjamin had a whopping 4 TD's for Red! These two teams are
    now in the middle of the pack in their division, let's see who rises to the top
    in this second half of the season!

  _results_5_game-ball: field_56d46fdeef15a
  results_5_description: 'Royal: OJ 4 TDs, Nix 1 TD, Nick & Jeremy 1XP each.  INT
    by OJ and Sacks by Jeremy and Charlie.  Gold: Clay 1 Sack; Neiswanger 1 INT &
    1 TD;  Ryan Boyle 1 TD'

  results_6_game-ball: Lindsey W. (Orange); Aaron R. (Navy)
  _results_6_game-ball: field_56d46fdeef15a
  results_6_description: Boaty Call received in the first half, and The Mangerines
    could do little to stop them.  On the first drive, Bryan Sanders found Will Chappell
    in the end zone (followed up by an XP1 by Baxter O’Brien).  After an interception
    by Adam Strasberg, Aaron Ross scored a TD (but the XP attempt was stopped by an
    interception by Ren McKinnon) to put the score at 13-0.  The Mangerines finally
    pulled it together in the second drive, with Ren throwing to Sean Karson for Orange’s
    first TD, but Navy’s Chappell responded with another TD.  With the clock running
    low in the first half, Ren found Sam Brown twice for a TD and XP1 to end the half
    19-13 (Navy).  However, Orange lost its focus in the second half and could not
    stop Navy.  Strasberg, Chappell, and O’Brien each had 1 TD.  Chappell had 2 XP1s
    and Baxter had an INT.

  results_7_game-ball: Eric C. (Sand); Austan M. (Neon Yellow)
  _results_7_game-ball: field_56d46fdeef15a
  results_7_description: 'Neon Yellow, still glowing from the Spring Break sun, shone
    brighter than Sand all day Sunday. In the first half, Tyler hit three different
    receivers for scores -- Binder, Andy Larson, and Diggy -- before running in one
    himself. Sandstorm only rustled up one, a lob from Long to MopTop nearing halftime.
    On defense, Larson and Diggy grabbed an interception each.  Hotchkiss and Austan
    "M" notched sacks. In the second, Foxy lit up the scoreboard with two unanswered
    touchdowns to Rudy and Binder before adding another on the ground. Andy Allen''s
    late interception and touchdown, plus Eduardo''s sixty-yard bomb weren''t enough
    to brighten Sand''s day. '

  results_8_game-ball: Adam S. (Olive); Alex P. (Forest)
  _results_8_game-ball: field_56d46fdeef15a
  results_8_description: In a battle of the (darker) Greens, Forest took undefeated
    Olive down to the very last drive. Alex Pane looked impressive filling in for
    QB Matt Cline as he was smart and methodical against a big Olive Defense. It helped
    to have YAC speedsters like Howard Yuan and Keith Combs, who had the Martinis
    stirring all game long. Eventually, some mistakes cost Forest the win as they
    lost by just one point. Olive is the hottest team in the first half of the season,
    but QB Brandon Waggoner knows what dominance looks like and this wasn't it!

  results_9_game-ball: Andrew C. (Gold); Brad A. (Navy)
  _results_9_game-ball: field_56d46fdeef15a
  results_9_description: 'Joe Heron earned his first career touchdown in Gold’s loss
    to Navy. Captain Clay Arnold added their only other score on the day: An early-series
    collision between teammates Andrew Carr and Craig Neiswanger knocked the wind
    from their and their team’s sails. For Navy, Will Coachman hauled in two scores
    from Bryan Sanders. Brad Allen and Baxter O’Brien pulled interceptions; Aaron
    Ross, an extra point. '

  results_10_game-ball: 'Jeremy S. (Royal Blue); Lindsey W. (Orange) '
  _results_10_game-ball: field_56d46fdeef15a
  results_10_description: Riding high after their 32-12 win over Gold, BATTLE ROYALE
    expected little opposition from the 0-4 Mangerines, but Orange wasn’t ready to
    yield.  Charlie Salem scored Royal’s first TD, but Orange stopped the XP attempt
    and responded with a TD of their own by Sean Karson.  Jim ran down the clock and
    gave the TD and XP1 to Jeremy Steslicki, leaving little time for Orange to respond
    and ending the half at 13-6.  In the second half, however, Royal destroyed Orange’s
    defense, putting up 2 more TDs (by Jim and OJ) and an XP (by Charlie) before Orange
    rallied.  Ren found supplemental pick Lindsey Walton, about whom Royal’s sidelines
    warned but against whom Royal’s defense could do nothing.  Karson stopped Royal’s
    next drive with an INT, allowing Isaac Voehringer to score the TD and XP1 to bring
    the score to 26-19.  With less than 2 minutes in the game, Levert James stepped
    in as primary rush, blocking and intercepting a pass by Connolly and giving Orange
    a chance to tie or win the game.  Karson scored on the 2nd of 3 plays to bring
    the score 26-25 (Royal).  Orange went for the win instead of overtime, but Ren
    McKinnon was downed 2 yards shy of the end zone, giving Orange their fifth loss
    of the season.

  _results_11_game-ball: field_56d46fdeef15a
  results_11_description: 'Jordan Anderson, Joe Green, Mike Hess, and Cody Barry scored
    touchdowns in Purple’s romp. Kyle Veldman and Andy Pratt mustered Black’s two
    scoes. Derrick Johnson continued to pile up sacks, adding another to his League-leading
    season total. '
