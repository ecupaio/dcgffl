  results_0_description: 'Royal YAAAAAAAS, FKA Les Dauphins, FKA I hate you, changes
    their name along with AJ Reusts mood swings.  I know where you can get some Lithium
    if y’all need it. This game would have been considered intense had it not been
    for the game that must not be named. The first half Royal backed that YAS up into
    a tie with the Eggplant Emoji’s. On offense the Marks, J & H, both had a touchdown
    for Purple along with a try ran in by QB1 Dave S. DeWayne A. and Sam B. had the
    sixers for Royal and with a try ran in by QB2 AJ. Defensively, Braden B. had two
    sacks for Purple, and Levert added an int for his YAS of the half. The second
    half was just as close with a game tying drive by Purple stopped by Dewayne A.
    with a game sealing interception tapping both feet somewhere on the field. Purple
    showed their finest with an added sack from Braden and int from Chris H., but
    Royals came up with three big defensive stops in the end: A fourth down stop and
    two ints by Dewayne A. Eggplant Emojis left the field with the Lorde’s voice echoing
    in their heads, “You’ll never be Royals”.'

  results_1_description: The DCGFFL is all about Sportsmanship! “Get off the bench
    and get into the game” is our league motto. While we might not have any Sportsmanship
    Award nominees in the running after this game, there's always next week. If all
    else fails we’ll just give it to Bryan Sanders again.  Because that makes just
    as much sense as last year. Maroon lost despite great offensive efforts from Austin
    and Smiffy. Charcoal won thanks to the receiving efforts of Morse and qb play
    of Adam Robbins.  Congrats Charcoal!

  results_2_description: The athletic heroics of Jordan Anderson weren't enough to
    plague the Ash team and a superb game from Kyle Mckinney, Scott G., James R. and
    Seaton. Jordan had 24 points out of 26 on the day for Black, but the combined
    efforts of Ash shoved it in the mouths of the plague by putting up 39 points.
    Brian Hotchkiss turned out to be the Plague Black has warned us about.

  results_3_description: 'Yo (t)HOTS, delete Grindr from y''alls phones and start
    paying attention to the game.  Vegas had six and won with their back up QB. The
    first half was a boring affair with an int from Andy and a sack by Derrick from
    Red. Vegas managed a lone TD and an int by Dameron.  The second half Vegas went
    all in on offense AND defense notching three ints: Matt(2) & another for Dameron,
    as well as three touchdowns to Markco (2) and Dameron. Red''s Miles managed a
    score before Dameron walked off the field yelling and wagging his finger, "BITCH
    I TOLD Y''ALL NOT TO COME FOR US, I TOLD Y''ALL. THAT WAS WITH SIX Y''ALL. WE
    ONLY HAD SIX Y''ALL".'

  results_4_description: The most racially tone deaf team name lost again on Sunday.
    We Love You Long Lime missed the mark on Asian American sensitivity as well as
    in the win column.  The first half was separated by one extra point with Lime
    and Safety Orange trading two touchdowns a piece, Tim A. and Captain Barry M.
    for Safety and Nick B. and Josh R. for Lime. Paddy Mac logged the 2 point conversion
    for Safety while Lime only managed a one pointer from QB Marvin. The second half
    fell in the Blumpkin's favor seeing two scores to Lime's one. Josh R came up big
    for all 7 points for lime, but Barry M and Tony S. logged two scores for the Blumpkins
    and Max R. sealed the deal with an extra point return for 2.

  results_5_description: 'Lime won this game by a sizeable margin.  It looks like
    CharredHoles lit themselves on fire in the second half and let Marvin W. completely
    take this game over.  People totally did things on both sides of the ball including
    QB Marvin Washington on Lime and Cam B. on Charcoal but this maze of a score card
    leads me to believe the referees were so bored by this trouncing they decided
    to give up around 8 minutes into the first half. '

  results_6_description: Royal and Maroon were able to keep their composure and play
    a full game with no incident. Dewayne ruled the stats sheet for Royal with four
    touchdowns.  Maroon had no answer to him. Dewayne's points alone weren't enough
    to seal the victory as Maroon had 27 points of their own, but Smiffy, Austin,
    Ken & Brandon couldnt uncut their way past the scoring line on Royal with Mike
    Z, AJ and others combing to add an additional 11.  Yas Qweens ya'll kept Maroon
    defeated on your way to having the most wins in the league.

  _results_7_game-ball: field_56d46fdeef15a
  results_7_description: WOOOOeeeEE! Both of these teams could score at will. Blumpkins
    got off their porcelain throne for just long enough to be out shot by Gold 41-37.
    Gold's QB Sheerod spread the ball around hitting six team mates for scores and
    tries. The Blumpkins shared the wealth themselves having four teammates log touchdowns.
    In the end Sheerod had the hottest hand and the game of no defense came to a halt.

  results_9_description: 'Sexual chocolate took advantage of the sasters of Alpha
    White in the first half Or should I say Kostyk took advantage of their team: he
    had an int, a td, and a one point try. Larry W. returned the favor in the second
    scoring two tds with a murtaugh try after an Earl A. interception, but Brown spread
    their sexual healing across the field with scores and tries from Sean K., Alex
    H. and two sacks from Matt N.'

  _results_10_game-ball: field_56d46fdeef15a
  results_10_description: Gay Super Bowl Participant QB Adam Martin decided to show
    up again this week. NINE kelly players showed up on the scorecard this week proving
    that perhaps Adam Martin knows how to find an open man. Just click on their team
    page thats who scored 5 tds and had sacks. Pacific Blue only score twice, once
    in each half. It was adorable.

  _results_11_game-ball: field_56d46fdeef15a
  results_11_description: Forest forgot to cheat. They also forgot to win. Bryan Sanders
    you listened to my advice last week and you didnt show up to this game! To their
    credit The Cream Pies stuck this one out to the end. Nothing on the scorecard
    int the first half and an explosion of points in the second converting three touchdowns
    and all three conversions.  Forest could only manage one td each half, one to
    Captain Joe H. the other to some straight person I don't remember because they
    have such a forgettable face, body and personality. They also converted their
    tries but it wasn't quite enough to stop the spector of Andy Allen (who was on
    the winning side despite not appearing on the scorecard once) from edging them
    out. 21-14 win for Neon Yellow! Congrats Long & JJ, enjoy this last win of the
    season until you play Red in a play in game.

  _results_12_game-ball: field_56d46fdeef15a
  results_12_description: Another game another routing for the Sky Curious Baby Blue
    Team.  Strokes of Midnight only managed one score off a missed flag pull at the
    end of the first half. Midnight drove the field but nearly always ended their
    drive with a Clevenger interception or pass break up to turn over on downs. Jack
    B, grindred down the field, scruffed up touchdown after touchdown and gay tindered
    the ball into the hands of his receivers. Jason, Aras, William & Tom all logged
    sacks against a floundering offense that left the second consecutive mercy rule
    for Baby Blue at 34-6.

  results_13_description: EESH. Power Blue had a garbage touchdown in the second half,
    otherwise it was all Fuschia and Jim C. Sean B had a wonderful game for an old
    lady locking down 13 points and an interception. Captain Adam S., Michelle, Scott
    and Jim did everything else. Damn this game was boring.
