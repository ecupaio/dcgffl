  By Tiara “T” Cypress -After a riveting inaugural season of competing for
  fields with five-year olds, drunk refs, and a non-existent championship
  game…..We’re back for Season 2! We have a new commissioner, new board member,
  and more participants than the previous season.  Here’s to taking out our
  workday frustrations out on each other, fighting soccer parents for parking,
  and some good ol-fashion flag football. Let’s get in to some Week 1 rankings:
season: 1
week: 1
rankings:

      No sleep looks good on QB Meg. Out here throwing TDs like she’s slinging
      diapers.


      The Baracooters were eating up the competition like a camel toe. But,
      Veteran and commissioner Jayme spent more time trying to pronounce “swag”
      than blocking the rushers and allowed 3 sacs ... .in a row..


      They can thank Jamilah for carrying the defense. By the third quarter
      Carolina Blue settled into their impending W and added insult to injury by
      letting Camille QB. Overall this team had a solid defense and offense and
      let’s see if Meg can lead yet another team to another championship…if we
      get to play it this year

      “Their in the splits, they have a funky haircut, and they rely on their
      defense.” We didn’t know what to expect with a team full of volleyball
      players…and Mecha.

      Mecha got a pick6 and Bre didn’t spare the blockers. Also, New QB-who dis?
      Maybe she’s the Pope with the amount of Hail Marys she was throwing.
      Offense was supported by Rookies Lex, Pam, and Dana and the team managed
      to score 3TDs, even if they were accidental. Let’s see how long Pink’s
      defense can carry the team as new QB Emily gets adjusted.

      Green eggs gone ham, it’s giving more like turkey bacon. With a team full
      of travel players and DC Fray Allstars, expectations were high for this
      team. Lizzie B returns for her second season as QB where she’s finally
      able to see over her blockers, but it didn’t matter because her receivers
      couldn’t catch many of her passes.


      Nikki couldn’t haul in enough one-hand catches to carry the team to
      victory-even if she had, the other team would have contested it. If
      Forrest green doesn’t get their act together then Captain Sam-I-Am Cline
      won’t be able to stop Nikki from benching the entire team.

      Twas a pretty dry scene for a team named squirters. There were dropped
      balls, bad passes, but, hey, at least everyone got to play! League
      favorite and new AARP card holder Lindsey, was catching more attitude than
      passes as the game went on. Captain Linda will have to balance the want to
      win the game v. miss congeniality as the season progresses.


      Lime green has a team full of potential and talent, and we look forward to
      next week’s game to see if the lime juice will be worth the squeeze. Don’t
      worry Lime green, the nice guys don’t always finish last…..just in this
      power ranking
