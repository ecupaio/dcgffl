  By Tiara “T” Cypress - Rain rain go away, come again…never! Friday’s misty
  rain set the tone for the evening. Today we witnessed the Cotton candy game
  and a battle of the salad greens! Come get your tea with T. Let’s get into the
  recap of week 3!  Before we start, let’s wish a speedy recovery to Pink’s
  captain Laurn Pruitt!

      We get it we get it, y’all are the best and your roster is stacked, bleh
      bleh bleh. This week QB Meg made a return, but not for long, and let Sara
      B and Jayme QB for the second half! Carolina Blue is really living up to
      their team name Baracooters, by having several players (Nik and Sara)
      catch passes with their cooters. I personally use mine for different
      purposes,but to each their own. Not much more to say about Blue, except
      your winning is starting to bore us! You one trick winning pony!

      The only shutdown that happened Friday was Forest Green shutting down Lime
      Green.


      No Nikki, no problem! QB Lizzie spread the ball with TDs and extra points
      by DyTiesha “DT” D., Nour, and Taylor H.. Although Taylor won MVP, the
      last P may stand for penalties instead of Player!


      Let’s not discount this team’s silent but effective defense. There were a
      “few” sacs and a handful of interceptions.


      While Forest green proved they are the superior green this week, we’ll see
      who will reign supreme when they rematch in week 6!

      “P - panic, I - interceptions, N - not their week, K - still not their
      week.”


      Pink took advantage of Blue’s QB change and Austyn caught a pick6. But for
      every action, there’s an equal and opposite reaction, because you could
      also find Austyn playing some aggressive defense and riding the back of
      Blue’s receivers…this isn’t a rodeo, it's flag football.


      At this point, I’m sure Pink wishes they could get the mojo back from week
      1. Maybe they should change their name to Cher Barbie so they could “Turn
      Back Time!”


      We know their morale took a turn after they lost their captain to an
      injury. Let’s give them a few more weeks to get adjusted…
      \****whispers****\** “*Psst…*..*there’s only 3 games left in the
      season”...* but we know you got this!

      Another team that may have to consider a mid-season name change. Maybe
      Lime-AID instead of Squirters. I don’t know if QB Mer knew which green she
      was throwing too as she threw to forest green more than she did to her own
      team. But she wasn’t afraid to run the ball under pressure, and Forest
      gave them a lot of it. Lime’s defense helped pick up the slack and forced
      Forest into a lot of tough 4th down situations. Captain Linda Pratt led by
      example with a lot of pass breakups and pulling flags like they owe her
      money!


      We hope lime uses the bye week to regroup, and uncover that potential we
      know they have! We love an underdog story….or you can just be satisfied
      with closing your rings!
