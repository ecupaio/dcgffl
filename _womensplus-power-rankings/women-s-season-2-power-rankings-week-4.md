  By Tiara “T” Cypress - Week 4 games were on Friday the 13th and we expected
  some real spooky vibes. Instead of a frightfest we got a snoozefest. Nikki got
  bored and left before the half…..and even the field lights were uninterested
  and decided to shut off at 9pm. #FridayNightNoLights  Ain’t much to recap for
  week 4 but I will do my best🤷🏾‍♀️

      Forest green came back from the bye week ready to hand Blue over their
      first L. The threat alone allegedly had Blue shooketh in their cleats as
      The Barracooters forfeited hours before kickoff. Three weeks off should be
      just what’s needed for Green Eggs to run the table up to playoffs.

      A game of the week with no game, how dreadful!&nbsp;


      The Barracooters were scheduled to rematch against their stiffest
      competition yet but couldn't get enough players and had to forfeit hours
      before the game. Looking at the remaining matchups we don’t foresee Blue
      getting another loss, so I don’t know whether to say, “Thank you”, or
      “You’re Welcome”.

      “Started from the bottom now we’re….one spot away from the bottom” Lime
      green ”*allegedly*” secured their first win with a familiar face, subbing
      in at QB was Em! Court H broke up passes, caught passes, returned a punt,
      and scored a TD all while playing in indoor soccer shoes. Maria proved she
      is more than just a blocker. Linda did almost everything on the defense
      except grow! Veteran Lindsey, also held down the team by scoring the extra
      point, a TD, and an INT…we won’t talk about the interception that she
      dropped after it hit her in the face. Also worth mentioning is a TD by
      Leah, sac by newbie Jacqueline….And all that in ONE half!

      Oh how the mighty have fallen. This week Pink had just enough to field a
      team. Their game against Lime turned out to be the battle of the QBs named
      Em and unfortunately Pink’s Em couldn't pull out the win. In fairness her
      arm is probably still recovering from Gay Bowl. On a positive note, Baby
      Bubs helped advance the ball a few times in a full knee brace. Other
      members of the team like Austyn and Pam made good contributions for the
      team.


      In hindsight, Pink may be thankful they only played a half and can use the
      bye week to re-recruit their own teammates!
