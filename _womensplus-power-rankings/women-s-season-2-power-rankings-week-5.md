  By Tiara “T” Cypress (with a little help from your neighborhood curmudgeon) -
  We're back from yet another bye week. It feels like we have more byes than 
  NSYNC. This week, there was a Full moon and every team harnessed its energy.
  Our lower seed teams were giving higher ranked teams a run for their money and
  making them work to keep their top spots. Ashley's Hollander finally made
  herself useful, reffing for the first and maybe last time. We're not sure she
  understands the concept. Yes you are supposed to watch the game, but you also
  have to officiate! The ONE time she used her flag turned out to be moot
  because Binder waived it off.

      I don't know if they don't get out enough, or if there's such a thing as
      "new mom telepathy", but Jayme and Meg were completely in-sync this game.
      Jayme also got to live out her long awaited slot-receiver dreams and took
      full advantage. Camille attempted to dress up like Zeke Elliot for
      Halloween, sporting her jersey as a crop-top all game. There was a lot of
      trash talking on Friday……but if you listen closely, it sounded more like
      whining with angry undertones. There were on-field debates on flag
      guarding and bull rushing…..if only we had a ref to get things under
      control.\*cough Ashley cough\* Overall, the Cooters played well, however,
      lime green was only a couple points away from stealing the W from them. Is
      this a sign of Blue running out of steam?

      This week forest green had to play lean! Captain Sam Cline prioritized
      futbol over football and had an injury that kept her out of the game. But
      her squad held it down \#NikkiWho?&nbsp; In her Week 5 season debut,
      Mariam played all over the field and got reps in at corner, rush, and
      slot. She even surprised herself (and perhaps some of pink) and scored a
      touchdown. Desiree and Taylor brought their hands to offense and defense
      catching TD’s and intercepting passes. A BIG shoutout to Erin who stepped
      up to play center! It's clear Forest's offense and defense are pretty
      solid whether they have 9 or 16 players. Let's see if they can hold off
      the newfound momentum of Lime Green next week.

      Okay Lime! We see you, stepping it up and coming two points from clenching
      a win over the top seed! Pretty sure no one saw this coming… including
      maybe…yall. How did y'all get there, let's recap? Rusher, Jac applied
      pressure and landed a few sacks. There's still an ongoing debate on
      whether they were legal rushes or bull rushes, but, no matter. Mer moved
      well in the pocket with the support of their blockers. Em and Court were
      making plays on both sides of the ball.


      Mal, a rookie to the league, played cone for the first time against a
      formidable opponent, and did quite well. Elle made a surprise appearance
      and scored a touchdown for the team. Linda held down the defense but she’s
      still hoping to grow a few inches. And lest we not forget Lindsey's
      one-handed catch?!? Lime green played quite a game this week and is
      definitely in the running for most improved team.

      BarbieLand was as empty as a case of Truly’s on a Sunday Funday. The
      Barbies were down to only one sub this night! Maybe everyone was preparing
      their overly used Barbie costumes for Halloween? Mecha closed her rings
      and got all her steps in by playing both sides of the ball... I'm sure she
      regretted it afterwards.


      Also making her week 5 season debut, Toya! Welcome to the league. On
      offense Alley was coming for Tiara's neck as a blocker. Make no mistake
      Jillian was a clear game MVP and was the biggest threat for Pink. As the
      number one receiver, Jillian's play had Forest green shift their defense.
      She had great punts for kickoff, a touchdown and almost ran back an
      intercepted 2pt conversion for more points before she ran out of gas. And
      we don’t blame Jillian. Maybe she’ll get a little more help next week.
      Let's see what Pink has in store for us during the final game of the
      regular season.
