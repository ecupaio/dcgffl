  Another week has come and gone, the seeds of greatness have been sown. How are
  all of these teams fairing so far? Will their reign continue? Or did they to,
  like the Cherry Blossoms, bloom way too early? One will have to wait until
  playoffs to tell, but this duo still has opinions on the matter…

      Who needs Denver? First time QB, long time all-star Shayne, shows that she
      truly is a jack of all trades who can play any position. Making her first
      QB debut, Shayne scored 26 points this week spreading the ball out on her
      offense. This experienced team showed the reason for the name as they set
      the early season record for the longest drive (probably) by marching down
      the field in a possesion that ended in...an INT. The only cracks this duo
      saw in this team is trusting the refs a bit too much where they almost
      punted the ball on a 2nd down. We knew any team led by Shayne and Lynch
      would be impressive, but this powerhouse of a team is the one to watch.

      So close, yet so far. Down one from last week, Orange is the New Flag has
      dropped in our rankings and on the shade. Despite what the readers may be
      thinking, this is not the result of what will surely become a season long
      grudge, this week, blame the lower ranking on the Red team for boosting
      Gold’s point differential. Orange played Sapphire this week and threw 2
      INTs, the Orange team followed in their own footsteps for a victory over
      Sapphire. By far the quietest game of the day, where this team lacks in
      volume it makes up with talent. Another strong showing on the ref stat
      sheets, this team is proving to be the one to beat.

      In hopes of beating the ageist allegations, these authors are no longer
      making comments on the average age of this team; we will leave that up to
      the team themselves; they know what they are. With a score of 12-36, they
      left it all on the field (last week). Rookie Sarah M. continues to
      impress, walking away with 2/2 of the team’s TDs this week proving that
      when not in the pocket throwing to the actual QB, they are an impressive
      receiver. This team has enjoyed a third place spot for two weeks, but this
      duo thinks that this reign may be coming to an end with Kelly Green right
      on their heels after their first win. Hopefully this bye week gives this
      team the time for a little R&R (rest and retirement) to sleep off all
      those early

      Well, this team was able to pull out a win in a 6 vs 6 game where the
      other team was missing their starting QB, a rusher, and a blocker.
      Honestly, quite shocked at the score of this game, considering the
      circumstances. QB Meg looked like a young Lamar, running all over and
      dropping dimes to Austyn in the end zone. Green Beans also had their \#1
      cheerleader, Amanda, moonlighting as a receiver, back in action sans
      brace. While she made a pulled hamstring look like a juke, the cheers
      never stopped, which showed quite impressive cardiovascular health. Best
      cheer of the day “These Beans are Steamed” could be heard throughout
      Carter Barron. We still have not figured out if anyone would actually like
      to eat these steamed green beans… Regardless, the Green Beans are really
      starting to come alive as the nice team, which no one would have been able
      to predict on draft day. Captain Amy was deemed sportsperson, and even
      told the Ref squad that a call in her favor was incorrect, and had them
      reverse it! We are looking forward to see if these beans can reach the
      tallest stalk after supplemental when their pod numbers should increase.

      This team cannot catch a break. Injuries, travel plans, illness, quite
      possibly a plague all tried to prevent this game from happening.
      Thankfully this division hates a forfeit, unless it’s the championship
      game, and pushed forward to play with six! Shoutout to Maria for rushing
      and blocking for these poor berries. Em did a great job holding down the
      fort as QB and shared passes with all five teammates. We really get the
      vibe that the berries and the beans were both looking to lose to increase
      their Supplemental Draft day odds… Merril made her debut in Women’s+ and
      dominated in the end zone, MVP Dana pulled in 15 points, Court had a game
      changing INT, and Leah had many receptions to drive the ball downfield.
      This team has so much potential, if only a whole bushel of Bluebies would
      show up.

      1. Easter cannot come soon enough for this team. We all hope that like JC,
      they can rise up from beyond the stone tomb on Sunday and be ready for the
      first April games. Last week, we thanked everyone for not chirping at the
      Refs. This week, we would like to say, too soon, as this team was not
      happy with any calls by our lovely all Women’s+ crew. QB Mere worked to
      bring the ball downfield, but First and Gold was ready for every play.
      Jacq got by veteran Commissioner Jayme, to sack Shayne, both Judy and Val
      had interceptions as well. These efforts were not enough to fight back
      Gold’s scoring. Fingers crossed that amongst the peeps, reeses, and
      cadbury eggs in their Easter basket, the bunny also left them a \#1
      Supplemental Pick, and higher attendance. We love the passion and heart of
      this team, but they need to start working together or risk holding down
      the last spot in the power rankings for the foreseeable future. I hope
      next week we can sing responsively:


      Anonymous Duo: “They have risen”


      Red-y or Not: “Risen indeed”


      All: “HALLELUJAH”
