  Welcome all to Week 4 power rankings. As we are nearly halfway through the
  season, teams are truly making a name for themselves in the W+ Division. The
  supplemental draft breathed new life into some teams, while others complicated
  their current systems, with too much talent. Let’s look ahead to see who is
  succeeding so far and who needs some more cheerleaders.

      This team came out strong in the first half with 3 TDs, a sack, and an
      extra point. QB Lizzie does not play favorites and loves to share the
      wealth, throwing TDs to three different receivers throughout the day.
      Maria, Tiff, and Keely all brought in a TD. Defense was also strong for
      Orange, as Keely had two INTs and claimed MVP for the league. I am not
      sure what happened to Orange in the second half, as they quieted down and
      had the game come way too close for comfort against last place Red. This
      team started the year off in the middle of our rankings, but at this
      point, they are looking to be the team to beat. Hopefully they maintain
      cool and calm for the rest of the season and start training up someone new
      to throw TDs during playoffs…

      Parting is such sweet sorrow- Gold as they kiss goodbye to their
      undefeated record. In a nailbiter of a game, this matchup was determined
      by one point. When the team needed their defense the most, they vanished
      allowing Green the 2 points they needed for the win. Despite the final
      result, this team played well on Sunday with plenty of stats. No doubt
      that this team recovers quickly to make sure that this is their first and
      only loss for the rest of the season.

      The only thing certain about this division are the captains becoming QB
      options for next season. Captain Amy, hot off her sportsperson recognition
      from last week, showed off her arm at Carter Barron on Sunday leading her
      team to take down the now once defeated Gold team. Look out QBs, when
      Amanda leaves her brace on the sidelines she is proving to be a tough
      rusher with 2 game changing sacks. Though a long way from their week one
      shutout, this team has yet to rise from the 3rd spot. With the strength on
      this roster, these authors have held out hope for this team every week to
      dominate, but they may just be waiting until playoffs to show what this
      team can really do.

      Welcome to the team Tracy C. or in my household, affectionately known as
      “Gucci Cellucci”. Boy is QB Jamiee happy to have this talent on her team.
      Thankfully, the rest of Bluebies decided to show up in numbers, greater
      than 5, and put turned in their frying pans to start catching passes from
      their QB. While Tracy was lighting up the runway, the rest of her
      teammates followed in stride, rocking the latest DCGFFL fashion: Court
      came out hot, with two TDs, Em prevented SapphicFire from scoring too much
      with some wild INTs, and Alley was implemented with quite a few dink and
      dunk first downs. If this team can stay healthy and keep showing up, they
      might jump quite a few spots on this list. Here’s hoping no more injury
      and misery for the Bluebies moving forward.

      How does a team with two of the best rookies in the league end up here?
      Honestly, not really sure. Sapphire has plenty of tricks up their sleeve
      to keep any defense on their toes, but unfortunately it also seems to do
      that their offense. These authors think that this Blue team could benefit
      from going back to the basics because the talent is there. Coming into the
      second half of the season, we hope that Sapphire can come out with that
      same fire that we saw in week one.

      The prayers worked. The bunny hath delivered. They have risen indeed! This
      team has more players and are better than ever. It is a matter of time
      before they take home their first win. Mere and Judy selected wisely in
      the supplemental bringing out two vets who immediately made an impact.
      This Red team gave Texas Orange a run for their money, and just came up
      short in the final moments. Holding them all to one TD in the second half
      was quite impressive. Mere found Pam twice in the end zone and Rachael
      once; a difficult task against the mighty Texas Orange. These authors
      believe within the next two weeks Red will start to move up in the
      rankings whether the rest of the division is Red-y or Not.
