  Back again! Sorry to our undying fans about missing last week. It takes a lot
  of work to be this shady! Alas, only one of us is here for this comeback so
  it’s more like the anonymous solo. Much like every other sport, the Women’s+
  games were much more entertaining than the Open division games so sit back,
  relax, and get ready for some shade. It’s a week late so it’s sure to be good!

      Still reeling two weeks later after losing to Kelly Green’s back-up
      QB/captain Amy, Gold came out to this game with a chip on their shoulder.
      After weeks of analyzing game tape and asking the entire league how they
      lost this last matchup, Gold was ready for this game. Word has it this
      captain QB matchup could be found on the sidelines reviewing plays as they
      happened. Technically still undefeated against starting QBs, this team is
      going into the end of the season with no competition in sight. I’m sure it
      has nothing to do with having the W+ commissioner on the roster...

      To the tune of Rihana \*That was quite a show...you really had me going\*.
      Y’all, Navy has been all over the place this season. From a preseason
      number 1 ranking to dropping far out of grace for the number 1
      supplemental pick, this team has risen from the ashes and is not at all
      humble about it. Jury is still out on whether or not the Navy team was
      told the first game was Week 5 so they could stack their roster going into
      the second half of the season. Board, I would like an official
      investigation! I think the supplemental pick-ups have a lot to do with
      this team’s recent uptick in performance (read attendance). Now not
      worrying about fielding a full team, Navy can focus on what it does best,
      letting Dana catch every pass. There is no mistake about it, this week’s
      59-7 game was impressive; though not very fun to watch.

      True to her word that nothing matters until playoffs, QB Meg on Sunday was
      just having a great time playing some football, no win necessary. Not sure
      what is going on QB 1s this season, but I am just glad it looks like they
      are having a ball. Facing off against number 1 team, Gold, the Green Beans
      put up a good fight but in the end, lost to Gold by 8 points. It could’ve
      been by at least 2 if Meg had thrown to Ashley’s hands instead of her
      face. Props to Green for still running routes while trying to run over
      their blocker.

      After enjoying some time at the top, Orange wanted to see what it was like
      on the bottom half of the rankings. I’m not even sure if the ads come down
      this far. Suffering from some game time injuries, this team plays with a
      lot of heart and you have to admit they are pretty fun to watch. We’ll
      call this a mid-season sump for Orange is the New Flag. Hoping for them it
      doesn’t turn into a second half blowout.

      Shaking the cobwebs off is Sapphire’s new QB 1, Sarah M. The former QB 1,
      Kori was busy moonlighting as star receiver who’s hips don’t lie (or
      break!). This is a tough week to face off against the league’s newest QB
      all star on Navy. Unfortunately, there is nothing I can say that is
      shadier than the final score of this game. Looking ahead to next week and
      the newly awakened Red tem, this team is going to have to show up and show
      out if they hope not to drop to the bottom of the rankings.

      Coming off a win at the Midseason Party where this team was given a
      participation trophy, this team decided to close off this weekend with a
      real win too. Em L., the team’s backup QB impressed the entire league with
      her lights out performance against a league heavy hitter, Orange is the
      New Flag. For once on the other side of a blowout, the team finally put it
      together for this team’s first win...6 games in. There is a lot of work
      left for this team if they hope to move up in the rankings and in our
      hearts, but given what we saw on Sunday, this team might even finish out
      the season ranked 5th.
