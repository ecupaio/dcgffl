  Hello Women’s+! The dynamic duo returns from vacation, ready to provide facts,
  and only facts, to what occurred this weekend at Carter Barron. What a
  scorcher on and off the fields it was. Competition was steaming on the
  gridiron and on the grill. Shoutout to Em L., our favorite grill daddy, for
  manning that thing in 90 degree heat without fainting, while keeping the
  burgers medium rare. Teams came out to celebrate the season, there actually
  may have been more players partying than playing… regardless, the games were
  equally as entertaining as the cornhole and Kan Jam. One more week is left in
  regular season play and we cannot wait to see who is atop of the regular
  season standings. As famously stated by a W+ QB, “Regular season doesn’t
  matter” and we are eagerly awaiting the playoffs.

      First and Gold continues to come up on top in these nail bitters. Some
      would say that the referees are providing preferential treatment to not be
      later questioned by politicians for their actions, others would say that
      these victories are earned. Regardless of theories, this team really is
      that, a team. Their veteran QB spreads the wealth to everyone, showing no
      favoritism. Captain Shayne is selfless as ever, playing center, when she
      is clearly one of the top receivers in the league. Cone Jayme can be seen
      sashaying down field, dodging defenders left and right, within 3 yards of
      the line, rookie Angel reliable in the end zone with sticky fingers, Britt
      attacking the opposing QBs, Mariam making wild catches, and Christine
      continuing to dive across the field for receptions, even though she claims
      to be too old to do that. This team is not only together on the field, but
      off as well crushing crossfit workouts and supporting each other, for
      example, Meghan, holding babies and calling plays with a black eye and
      stitches. One can only imagine what would happen if everyone came to a
      game and played in their preferred position… We are looking forward to the
      playoffs to see if any team can knock this group of individuals down,
      perhaps the only way is if the First Lady requires an emergency visit to
      console upset Chicogians regarding the removal of their beloved “rat hole”
      on Mother’s Day and a Bee-mergency at USDA, happen simultaneously.

      This move up in the rankings is brought to you by the supplemental draft
      and a forefeit. Just kidding. While those two elements have really aided
      in propelling Greenbean’s rating, ace receivers, killer defense, and
      positive attitudes have sprouted their success. If no one decides to step
      up, they could continue the climb to the top and give Meg a 3-peat; do we
      really need a W+ GOAT/Dynasty established in the first three seasons?
      Fingers crossed interim Captain Ashely can use her teacher prowess to keep
      attendance greater than 6 players for the remainder of the season, while
      \#1 Sportsperson and Captain Amy goes overseas to probably run
      ridiculously far for “fun”. Red’s been on a roll and may steam these beans
      for Sunday Dinner, but lately, they’ve been nothing but farm fresh and
      full of vitamins.

      Bluebies are on a rollercoaster flopping everywhere! This team is still
      number one in TDs and points, so we guess they could afford a forfeit?
      There is some level of confidence to be had when you have more attendance
      at a cookout than the game. Jaimee has thrown 25 TDs to 7 different
      receivers. This stat is insane to have for her only playing 6 games, with
      an average attendance of 5 teammates! If anyone is coming for First and
      Gold in the playoffs, it’s the Bluebies. We are hoping everyone comes to
      work these last few weeks to topple the reigning champ; we love a zero to
      hero story. \*Go Sox

      Orange is the New Flag, what is there to say. The passion. It is so very
      real. This team leaves it all over the field. Lizzie throwing lasers to
      Keeley and Tiff, 50 yard dimes to Laila, and juking around defenders. T
      and Jamilah hold down the Defense with many a sack and INT. However, this
      team just keeps barely losing to their opponents. There is so much promise
      here. With one week in the season and a DH ahead of them, this team could
      climb at least one rung, which would be best, as they’re playing First and
      Gold, again. This week’s game was so close and competitive, we cannot wait
      to watch the repeat next week. As an aside, this duo would like to request
      that Lizzie stop moonlighting as Josh Allen, sans helmet, so she can
      continue to play out the rest of the season.

      Sapphicfire’s QB/receiver swap was done just in time. This team is really
      starting to gel and having Kori’s hands back in the game is a massive win
      for the group. Rookie QB Sarah M continues to dazzle and amaze the
      geriatrics on this squad. Refs have begun to complain that they cannot
      announce the time remaining any louder. We all know that this lack of
      listening is age related, and not because they are 100% dialed in, as
      claimed. Sapphicfire was regretting the decision to reduce the second half
      of their DH game by 5 minutes in order to get a Metamucil in before the
      cookout, after Sarah, Kori, Aubrie, and Nour marched the team back
      downfield. Unfortunately, The Greenbean’s clock management took over and
      stole a victory right from the feet of their walker’s tennis balls. We
      hope that their game plan is ready, dentures glued in tight, and ready to
      bare teeth next week against First and Gold.

      Maybe we spoke too soon announcing that this team could take the 5 spot.
      Despite their best second half efforts, Red could not put it together for
      another blowout win this week. One would have never known that they were
      losing as Captain Judy could be heard throughout the DMV screaming “Yeah
      Sherrie!!” and “We got this!!” Red needs to embrace that enthusiasm and
      feel great! It seems this team’s success depends on their full team
      attendance. Despite what their record reflects, this team could have a
      sneaky upset in them come playoffs, as long as they have their full roster
      (especially their starting QB). This team has some great league talents
      who can pull it together when they need to and as seen last week, when
      they come together, it’s an impressive sight to see. Stay strong Red
      players, winning only matters in the playoffs.
