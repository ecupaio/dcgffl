  We did it. Another season in the books. Here’s to not canceling all games due
  to rain this weekend. Boo to all of the weather related complaints. Third
  time's the charm for a complete season in the W+ Division. Let’s all cross our
  fingers and make sure that the Championship game is not decided in a forfeit.
  This duo is looking forward to the first weekend of playoffs and we are
  excited to celebrate all our Mom’s on Sunday! This anonymous duo is taking a
  bow for a season full of shade and we want to wish all the team’s the best in
  these final weeks. We will see YOU at the closing party.

      This team is poised for a fantastic playoff run, as long as their QB is
      available and the team remains healthy. Shayne, Mel, and Jayme are all
      looking for their third W+ title, this one earned, not handed over. Lynch
      made a victory against Sapphicfire look easy, even without Captain Shayne.
      Game 2 Lynch had to “work”, and only played half a game, and lost to
      Orange is the New Flag, pushing the Green Beans down a spot in the
      rankings. Jayme did her best at QB against Orange, and lost by only 1
      point, which says far more about Orange than Gold… Meg B, Week 8 MVP, came
      out strong with 19 points; we highly recommend that someone starts
      guarding her. Also, recommendation, teams should also stop throwing in the
      general vicinity of Taylor, who will OBJ passes from the sky. Rumor has
      it, this team is donning Red pom poms and jerseys at the 8:30AM game, as
      they think this is the path of least resistance to the top.

      What a comeback for this team. After a brief stint in the bottom half of
      the rankings (we would like to think it was from our motivating words from
      our rankings last week), the double header double win could not have come
      sooner for Orange. The rain and the other team’s schedules seem to have
      been on their side this week. At the 9:00 game, Orange’s rusher could be
      seen slipping into Navy’s QB for a sack...after sack....after sack. Word
      on the street is Orange heard that Navy did not want to play in the rain
      and decided to use the weather as a sneaky 8th player on the field. In the
      second game, we were treated to an early potential championship matchup
      between the first and second ranked teams where Orange came out on top. We
      can thank Lynch’s “job” for this win. This duo is excited to see what
      happens next week vs Navy or Sapphire to see if Orange’s luck holds up.

      If there was any doubt before, let us clear that up for you now- the QB
      makes or breaks these games. Green missing their starting QB, and back up
      QB, and their third QB, makes a HUGE difference. First time QB, long time
      player, Erin, stepped up and definitely deserves kudos for her
      performance, unfortunately for Green, it wasn’t enough. To be fair to the
      team, they were handicapped with no bench (not counting Kori), no ball, no
      QB, and no captain. Despite those obstacles, this team came out and played
      with a lot of heart, that’s not too hard with Amanda on your team. Next
      week, Red and Green get to have a rematch with both team’s (mostly) full
      roster. It will be one to see, and Meg we know nothing has mattered so
      far- let’s see what you can do!

      The game this week shows the power of a positive attitude! (and a negative
      one). Minutes before game time, the energy on Navy’s sidelines was like
      the weather, depressing. From the beginning of the game it was clear that
      no one wanted to be there and unfortunately the gameplay showed. Despite a
      strong opening drive with a beautiful touchdown pass to Dana, this team
      could not get on the same page. We will give some credit to the rain for
      making conditions less than ideal, but the costly penalties can’t be
      blamed on Mother Nature. As we have said before, this team is strong- when
      they are there. Now we mean mentally and physically. Also contributing are
      some unfortunate injuries to their strongest players, with 3 broken
      fingers and other ailments, this team may be limping into playoffs, but,
      this duo’s hope is not gone yet! When this team wins, they blow the other
      team’s out of the water and there is no doubt that playoffs could be their
      best run yet! Let’s hope it doesn’t rain on Sunday for their sake.

      Sapphicfire managed to score 14 against mighty Gold, but it was not good
      enough to secure a victory. Regardless, a W would have only boosted moral,
      and not Sapphicfire’s standings. Kori and Nour were the only two players
      able to score. Great news for the team is that Sarah M continues to look
      stronger in the pocket every week. Kori also proved that age is just a
      number, as they danced down the field, dodging flag pulls, laying out, and
      making endzone barrel roll catches, showing off those synthetic hip
      joints. Jeannie also denied Taylor, three times, by jumping very high, and
      maybe some light holding. The battle of the blues is starting at 8:30AM
      Sunday. Captain Steph, put those reading glasses on and start reviewing
      tape: let’s hope for the Sapphic’s sake, there is not a repeat of the last
      time these two teams met, where Bluebies were playing on another level.

      Red came ahead against the Green Beans on Sunday thanks to their opponent
      having a volunteer QB, less than 7 players, penalty calls, and mud. Their
      defense managed to have 4 INT, quite impressive, but let’s see if they can
      do that against Green Beans again this week, when QB1 Meg is back in the
      pocket. Em L is starting to get comfortable with her receivers, tossing
      TDs to Val, Stacey, and Pam. Pam impressed with great defense and a 60 yd
      TD. Did y’all know she also moonlights as a Kickball Gay? We have some
      work to do to convert her to a full time footballer… Captain Judy, get
      your troops in line and stop holding those rushers, maybe you can come out
      ahead on this one. Remember, opposing QB Meg has famously said, nothing
      matters until the playoffs.
