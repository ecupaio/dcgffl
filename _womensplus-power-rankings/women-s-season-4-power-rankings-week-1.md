  Welcome back to another season of the W+ DCGFFL! Season 4 is upon us and we
  are bigger and better than ever. This Duo had a rousing summer and is already
  slacking in our duties… apologies for no preseason rankings. Let’s look back
  to week one and see who fared well and not so well and as always, may the odds
  be ever in your favor.

      **19-0 vs Citrus Got Real**: If we were going to do preseason power
      rankings, our money was on Bush Gard’ems. This team will be incredibly
      difficult to beat with veteran QB Lynch, protected by Judy and Jayme.
      Lynch has nothing but time to throw to her fierce receivers, all 6’-5” and
      taller, dimes. In addition to that, the rush combo of Dinora and Sam C.
      has opposing lines trembling in their cleats, due to their speed and
      toughness. Although not all receivers on this team are as graceful as Des,
      one of whom nearly received a flag guard call for running like
      Frankenstein, the majority of these receivers can catch, run, and get out
      of the way of defenders. The only problems in this team’s future will be
      delay of game penalties for Judy’s inability to get on the field in a
      timely fashion and Lynch’s wild habit of asking how much time is left on
      the play clock, after running down the line to whisper a play change in a
      receiver’s ear, on every down. HINT: The ball is going to Des.

      **18-13 vs BlU-Haulers**: 2nd place for 2 first time team leaders on the
      same team, who allowed that to happen? An impressive game on both sides of
      the ball, at least in the second half. Yeah Glow started out slow with a
      couple missed reads and a few interceptions while Blue managed to keep
      them out of the endzone. Game 1 is rough for everyone so we are giving
      Yellow some slack for a less than ideal start but a dazzling finish.
      Yellow more than made up in the second half managing to score 3 TDs and
      keeping Blue out of the endzone. Hopefully the magic elixir that brought
      this offense to life doesn’t run out into week 2.

      **14-7 vs Pink Pony Club**: New QB Shayne and Veteran Captain Christine
      somehow left the draft with arguably the most lethal rush in the country.
      How any other captain allowed this to occur in the draft is a mystery to
      us. In addition to this, they walked out of the draft with the
      interception Queen of last season, Taylor H. There are several other vets
      on this team to assist the many rookies in their midst. While this team
      has a lot of promise, Maroon barely came out of this game with a W. With a
      name as cocky and confident as theirs, the Currants currently are just
      kinda, sorta, better, than you…

      **13-18 vs Yeah Glow**: Staying true to Meg’s DCGFFL motto, everyone makes
      the playoffs in this league so might as well have a little fun. Blue
      started off with a dominant lead in the first half with Kori showing up
      all over the stat card with INTs, TDs, and XPs, showing off yet again,
      that their hips don’t lie. Up by \*checks notes\* 2 TDs at the half, Blue
      decided to use all that momentum and change everything that was working
      well. I would not go so far to say that it looked like an entirely
      different team in the second half but I will say at least Blue looked like
      it was having a lot of fun. As always, this duo knows better than to doubt
      Meg, especially with a captain like Ashley and a roster full of first time
      leaguers but long time players. This team may have slipped in the second
      half but we have no doubt that the second game will show the league what
      this team can do.

      **7-14 vs Currant-ly Better Than U**: Oh mama, they’re just having fun.
      Missing their starting QB, 1/2 of Em&Em had to play both captain and QB.
      Though the final score does not count as a W, these authors have to give
      props to the pink team’s blocking for going against the Maroon team’s
      double threat of a rush (I’m sure this is the last time we will have to
      give out this kudos this season, right?!). Facing a first time QB in
      Shayne, this team played hard until the very end.The pink pony club has
      great vet talent as well as some rookies that I am sure will prove a
      problem later this season.

      **0-19 vs Bush Gard’ems**: This captain QB pairing of Amanda D and Sarah M
      has been rated the best vibes in the league. Citrus Got Real is also
      stacked with talent of veterans and rookies alike. The score does not
      accurately reflect the skill, and most importantly, passion of this team.
      One has never lived until they have seen Amanda flying through the air
      with a fresh ACL for a sack. Even on the IR, Meg B came out to call
      defensive schemes on the sidelines. Regardless of this enthusiasm, Sarah
      M’s chill midwestern demeanor will only last so long if her group of
      speedy receivers continue to drop the beautiful passes she is throwing
      them. Hopefully next week this squad will be complete, with their missing
      veterans coming back from vacation and the IR. Sit back, grab an orange
      crush and watch this citrus tree grow to its fullest potential as they
      start their climb up the ranks next week.
