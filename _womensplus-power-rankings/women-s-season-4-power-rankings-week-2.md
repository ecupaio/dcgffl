  Welcome back for Week 2 Power Rankings! Yet again, as 1/2 of the anonymous duo
  I find myself writing alone as my co-conspirator apparently had more important
  things to do on Sunday rather than watching flag football. With 2 games under
  our belts, the rankings were shaken up a bit after the scorecards were turned
  in. Now let’s get into this analysis of Week2 of the DCGFFL!
season: 4
week: 2
rankings:
  - team: _womensplus-teams/s04-women-s-forest-green-bush-gard-ems.md
    record: 2-0

      An early season leader, this team remains the only undefeated team left in
      the division. We are so surprised (cue eye roll). Down veteran blocker,
      Jayme, and joined by yet another rookie heading into this game, no one on
      this team looked worried; other than Judy on the sidelines when her
      defense was...working? Overall, this is a strong team not showing any
      signs of slowing down. Attn Blu- Lynch and Des are gone next week, use it
      to your advantage. We will see if Green can hold strong and guard their
      lead as long as Lynch holds the ball.

      Who can be surprised that Meg climbed up the ranks to place second this
      week? Rumor has it that Blue learned their lesson to not fix something
      that isn’t broken as far as lineups go. By the second half, this could
      have been anyone’s game, until Kori got to showing off again. Both Blue
      and Maroon had no problem letting the two let’s say “most experienced”
      players on the field, Kori and Christine, carry this matchup. For any new
      players in the league, it is nice to get a preview of what playing in the
      league 5 years ago was like too. In their matchup against Green next week,
      this team is a division favorite to unseat Green’s reign at the top.

      Another team affected by the Ragnar races, Pam was off “working” and Nour
      came back with concrete in her legs. Despite being unable to technically
      move, Nour and Co. pulled off a second half comeback, something their team
      is starting to get a reputation for. While the comeback was not quite
      successful, I have to hand it to this team for making Orange fight for
      their first points of the season. Despite their first half underdog second
      half superstar status, I think it is too early in the season to count this
      team out; the second half of the season might be their redemption tour.

      Ragnar strikes again! Someone tell that organization that more important
      things are going on, like Sunday morning football at Carter Barron.
      Despite being down a few key players and many players having to play both
      sides of the ball, this team showed out and managed to get 3 sacks on Meg.
      Though it is more impressive that they made it past Ashley’s block and
      less that they got to the only QB in the league that would rather kneel
      one out than run the ball. Despite the best efforts with only 9 players,
      this team was tired and couldn’t edge out the win. With a full roster and
      some stickier gloves, this team is nowhere near done.

      Rounding out the team’s with 1-1 records, we have Neon Orange! This team
      showed out in the first half proving that they can be on both sides of a
      shutout- at least in the first half. Led by Sarah M. who wasn’t running
      from the airport, this team was firing early with 3 INTs and some points
      on the board with a healthy Meg B. The defense was playing so well that
      they decided to give Yellow’s defense a taste of what that was like by
      throwing a few INTs themselves. With their first win under their belt,
      this team is hungry for more. With a full roster, I have no doubt that
      they are going to rise through these rankings.

      Maintaining their lead as the team that is having the most fun, this team
      played a close game with Forest Green. The Pink Ponies came ready to take
      on Week 1’s strongest defense and did it with a little bit of style.
      Pink’s defense stopped Green’s charge down the field twice during this
      game showing off what some of the best defensive players in the league can
      do. A few would be interceptions prevented Pink from putting this in the W
      category.
