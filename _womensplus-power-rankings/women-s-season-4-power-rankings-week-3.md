  Anonymous <3. One third of the season has passed and the tides have turned in
  the rankings. No one can achieve the perfect season with a herd of rushers
  sacking QBs left and right.  We are looking forward to the start of double
  headers next week where the onslaught of questions regarding how long
  regulation play is, is neigh.

      Surprise, surprise, Atomic waltzing their way to the top of the rankings.
      A little early for QB Meg, who believes it only matters in the playoffs.
      Somehow, five sacks means nothing to this vet as she dropped a series of
      three TDs to Rookie Catherine and 8-points to DCGFFL Rookie, “Made by
      Meg”, Morgan. Note to the other teams: maybe guard Morgan? We’ll see how
      the BlU-Haulers fair against Bush Gard-Ems when Lynch returns with a
      vengeance.

      The winning team of this week’s never ending game sees themselves rising
      to the second spot this week. Though no one looked excited to play OT,
      those XPs brought them to second place. These authors were impressed by
      rookie Jé whose height helped a lot, towering over Maroon’s blocker to
      sack Shayne for the first time this season. Led by Pam (and probably
      Lindsey) on the offense, this team finally managed to score some points in
      the first half. They should frame that first half score card and use it as
      motivation for the rest of the season to finally put that underdog title
      to rest. I love being proved right and we predicted week 1 that this team
      was going to be one to beat as we watched this team hold their own against
      a very impressive Maroon team. Rumor has it that they will be missing some
      players next week, let’s see if the double pushes them ahead or behind the
      pack.

      If the ref crew was asked one more time in this game how much time was
      left, Jayme was getting ejected. However, this question was
      understandable, seeing as Jayme was thrown to the fire to QB while Lynch
      is sans cell phone rafting down some river in Chacos. While the offense
      was less than stunning, the bright spots in this game were five sacks by
      the Forest Rushing trio of rookies Sam and Christa and veteran Dinora.
      This duo was also very impressed with the hustle of captain Judy, running
      faster than we have ever seen her move after a BlU-Hauler… they must be
      going steady or someone stole the relationship cat if Judy was ready to
      jump on that truck.

      Well, well, well. This team is getting very used to shut outs arent they?
      They are a long way from Week 1, proving to everyone what a positive
      attitude and a little more playing time can do for a team. It is fitting
      that this team is led by Amanda, who loves Meg’s playing style. Once they
      were ahead, they decided to switch up everyone’s role, even who was QB.
      Lex ran away on the stats this week managing 3 TDs but falling short on
      scoring a 4th in the QB category. On the sidelines, as we watched
      defensive allstar, Jamiliah line up on the offense, we knew that Orange
      was feeling pretty comfortable. Now that we know this is a team full of
      verses,, next week, as they play double headers, we will see if they
      manage to switch to the top of the rankings.

      Whelp, maroon is still Currant-ly Better Than… Neon Pink, so we guess the
      name still works this week. Their record does not reflect the absolute
      chaos and passion that occurred in their game this week.We interviewed the
      ref crew from this game and they are all still recovering from the sass of
      this squad. Nik came through with a pick 6 then a TD to tie up the game,
      leading to an intense OT, ending with a tough call against maroon. The
      Currants need to hold a practice or two, speed up their offensive game and
      get on the line to leave QB Shayne some time to breathe. With arguably the
      best defense in the league, the Currants are going to be a team to watch
      deeper in the season.

      I do hate to kick a team when they are down...that being said considering
      the score this week, making any joke would be in bad taste. We do believe
      that we saw some really great plays made by pink. Plagued by slippery
      footballs and citrus’ ability to be right where you don’t want them, this
      team was unfortunately not able to keep any offensive momentum. They
      managed to stop Orange a few times but without scoring, there is not much
      a defense can do. This week was supplemental draft, keeping our fingers
      crossed that EM2 picked up someone who can get them moving in the right
      direction.
