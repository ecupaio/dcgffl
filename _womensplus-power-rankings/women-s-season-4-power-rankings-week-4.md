  Anonymous! The halfway mark of the season has arrived signaling the point in
  the season when we can finally say that every team has won a game. As there is
  no longer a risk of a perfect losing record, this duo would love for us all to
  acknowledge that this season has been all over the place. THREE separate teams
  have taken up the first spot and  my, have these rankings changed in the past
  month. Supplemental has come and gone, attendance is shockingly high for all
  teams, and the rain hasn’t stopped us, yet. Let’s see where the standing lie
  after the first week of double headers and after the much needed BYE week: 
season: 4
week: 4
rankings:
  - team: _womensplus-teams/s04-women-s-neon-orange-citrus-got-real.md
    record: 4-1

      This team has won more than the attendance award this season. Now that
      Citrus is healed up and the wedding season is officially over, they are
      flush with players. What was originally assumed to be the just vibes team
      has come ahead in the standings to show that they can be chill and win
      big. Shoutout to Metz for completing her first extra points of the season
      in a big win against the BlU-Haulers. This defense is stacked with
      Veterans in the back and an incredibly fast and effective rush in front,
      offense full of hands, and a QB that stays calm, no matter what. Hopefully
      they can keep the good vibes flowing for the rest of the season and remain
      on top of the rankings.

      This duo loves to keep Bush Gard’Ems in the two spot to get the uber
      competitive duo of Judy and Lynch riled up for game day. Regardless of the
      rankings, this team has been extremely successful, spreading the wealth to
      receivers, reading offenses well, and just overall dominating the field.
      Having Des and Milla back as well as Merril remembering her hands, lead to
      a big W for the Bush offense. Sam, Christa and Dinora continue to dazzle
      at rush with a combined 12 sacks, most by any team in the league. Lynch
      has also only been sacked 2 times, which is no surprise with Jayme, Maya,
      and Judy protecting her. The next time we play, Forest has a doubleheader,
      if they win both, maybe we will move them to number 1…

      We are very fickle with our ratings aren’t we? Bring teams up just to drop
      them down again very similar to Meg’s flags this weekend. It was all love
      on the sidelines between Amanda and Meg but on the field, Meg’s flags were
      irresistible. What a nailbiter of a game, only made worse by having to
      play on field 4.I am not sure that Blue would admit that they lost this
      game, something tells me they would chalk this up to a win for the refs.

      I said just last week that I love being proved right, so why oh why yellow
      did you make a liar out of me? I am pretty sure that every person in the
      league that knew they were missing week 4 ended up on this team. What a
      week for most players to be out with only 5 players left to field a double
      header. Fortunately for them, yellow elected to forfeit game 2 and head
      home to get dry and away from Carter Barron at all costs. Keeping with
      tradition for the season, Yellow was on the bad side of this week’s
      shutout (seriously, there has been one every single week). Unable to
      really get the offense moving this team has dropped to \#4. Because I am
      hopeful to a fault, I still think that this team is nowhere near done.
      There is a lot of football left and I would not count them out, please
      prove me right again.

      Moving on up! In our hearts and in our rankings. Someone has to be at the
      bottom, and it’s not you! Finally finding some joy on the sidelines, Pink
      could be heard celebrating their first TD in two weeks during their show
      off against Yellow. My sources say that they went in ready and they showed
      out, against a team that could only field 5 players this week. This duo
      swears that we could hear them whisper “we really needed this” before
      their end of game cheers. We would NEVER take away a win from a team, a
      win is a win. We are looking forward to seeing Pink renewed after their
      win, hopefully this weeklong break keeps the momentum pushing. Much like
      Chappel Roan, this duo cannot in good faith endorse any team to win but we
      are comfortable saying just get out and play, no matter what side you are
      on!

      We are so sorry Maroon… you are Currant-ly better than… no one. With the
      same record as the NE Patriots, it may be time to switch up the playbook
      and move some humans around and get Taylor a bionic ankle. The Currants
      have a tough doubleheader setup after the bye week where they will have to
      face the 1 and 2 teams back to back. We have faith that this team will
      start to rise again; remember, rankings do not matter until the playoffs.
