  Anonymous! Welcome back DCGFFL-ers. What a beautiful turnout for week 5 by our
  fans and players to celebrate being a part of the W+ Division! We all
  celebrated the season with a lovely cookout and a series of 4 riveting games
  to spectate. As the weather starts to take a turn for the chilly season, let
  us see where our teams sit after the bye week.
season: 4
week: 5

      We had to give it to them. Bush Gard’ems is number 1 in these rankings,
      finally. What took us so long? Maybe it was the threats of Judy and Lynch
      that finally got to us? Maybe it was a phenomenal performance by Merril,
      who finally stopped wondering what time it was and decided to catch a few
      TDs? Maybe it was Jayme just being so darn nice to everyone! Whatever it
      was, this team is definitely leading the charge this season with points
      scored, sacks given, and interceptions. I think all of us here are looking
      forward to the match up with Citrus Got Real next week to determine who
      the real \#1 seed is heading into the last turn of the season.

      Unsurprisingly, Orange comes alive when all of the players on the roster
      are actually able to make the games. With a defense run by Meg, they gave
      Maroon a hell of a time trying to get into the endzone. Word on the street
      Orange is the favorite to win in next week’s match up against Green. Not
      in points, but where it matters, in our hearts. Though they have the same
      record as Green, I think everyone just wants to see if Metz has what it
      takes to do what no other team has, beat Lynch. Given their performance
      last week with yet another shut-out for the Maroon team, it seems well
      within their grasp.

      Kori is back from their most recent age related injury to score 12 points
      and an INT. These stats are incredible considering they did all of this
      while holding up their pants and illegally wearing their flags. Best stat
      of the weekend, big 20+ yard TD by Captain Ashley to let people know that
      blockers matter too. Although their record does not show it, this team is
      destined for the final 4. Meg is just heating up and if their vibes stay
      as cool as their champagne sideline celebrations, this team is destined
      for greatness.

      Yeah Glow has a lot going for it. With so many vets and strong rookies,
      this team is second in interceptions and sacks, however has been
      struggling to finish games strong. Most interesting stat comes from
      Lindsey, who in addition to having a coordinating fit for each of the 24
      possible team colors, has had 4(!) interceptions, playing both sides of
      the ball, every game, at approximately 67 years of age. If Lindsey comes
      to play this hard, the rest of the team has no excuses to ball out for the
      rest of the season. Yeah Glow has so much potential to climb back the
      rankings. Maybe now that Captain Nour is complete with international
      travel, road races, and miscellaneous queer weddings, Yeah Glow can have a
      big comeback this weekend against Maroon!

      The Rise and Fall of the Pink Pony Club. They say never meet your heroes,
      or in this case, name your team after them. Coming off a win against
      Yellow last week, we were excited to see how Pink did against the now \#1
      Green and well... honestly we were impressed. The new supplemental pick
      for Pink made early waves in their first game of the season on offense and
      defense coming away with a touchdown and MVP. Pink also managed to keep
      Green out of the endzone a few times. Once Pink gets rid of those pesky
      INTs, they can put together an impressive team. One thing we can count on
      this season is that the Pink team will leave it all on the fields.

      Maroon is unfortunately currently beating only themselves. Truly we would
      like to stop making these kinds of jokes, but with a team name like this,
      the jokes truly do write themselves. With a stacked roster like this, we
      are surprised that they are limping into the second half of the season.
      Lacking their captain heading into the double-header weekend, Shayne
      filled the role of captain, QB, and board member all at once. Out of
      respect for that feat, we won’t talk about the first game, but we will
      talk about the second game. Credit where credit is due, this team came
      alive against Green, on the field and on the sidelines. We have never seen
      so many refs in lawn chairs and team jerseys. The good news? It is almost
      the playoffs where things like “records” and “points scored” don't really
      matter. Don’t let this record fool you, these underdogs still have some
      bite left in them.
