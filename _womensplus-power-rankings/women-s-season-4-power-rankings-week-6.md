  Anonymous! This duo is just barely gets these power rankings out in time for
  next week’s games. Just like 2 of this weeks’ games, we do not know who is
  going to come out on top. I am already looking forward to the next bye so I
  can nurse my poor twitter fingers back to health. We have an exciting week of
  games to recap for your reading delight.

      How can we say this gently? Never have we seen a game played so hard for
      so little points, except maybe this week’s game between Pink and Blue.
      With a mostly full roster, only short Des and 0 reported injuries, Green
      looked well rested on the sidelines as they slowly descended into panic
      into the final seconds of the game. Something they would not have had to
      worry about if they could figure out the difference between blocking and
      holding or throwing the ball and jumping. Despite all this, Lynch is still
      undefeated in games she actually played. The Green team rode this high all
      the way to Shaw’s and Kiki for a Sunday Funday I am sure they all forget.

      Having held the number one spot this season, it is no surprise that Orange
      finds themselves among the top. What is surprising, and equally
      impressive, is that they played how they did on Sunday with only 1 sub.
      Pretty sure that orange was outnumbered by Green AND by the babies on the
      sideline. That is also equally as embarrassing for the Green team. Luck is
      on this team’s side as their 2 TDs this week were the result of 2
      individual plays. If the only time you score is on huge plays, does that
      make you a good team or a lucky team? Considering how many shutouts they
      have had this season, my guess is the former but Orange has yet to beat
      the Green team yet. If it’s the final matchup we are expecting, Orange
      needs to come up with an answer for Lynch.

      With no Meg, can we still say nothing matters until playoffs? An absent
      Meg means that Kori came back out to play QB, something they have not been
      subjected to, I mean treated to, since last season. Blue was trying to do
      anything except score to give themselves a win this week, managing to get
      into the endzone only one time. Though the score did leave the offense
      missing Meg, Blue managed to somewhat successfully keep Pink out of the
      endzone, at least until the final moments. Listen to your captains folks,
      XPs matter, just ask the Pink team.

      Well, the currants came to play this week. In case you didn’t know, QB
      Shayne hates losing. Shayne took the game into her own hands, by
      personally scoring 12 points, throwing 2 additional TDs, and pulling an
      INT from the air. Look out for this team in the last few weeks as they try
      to live up to their confident name and take home the ship, and not just a
      Dundie for the most unique team name.

      Attention Glowers: the season is not over yet! You have a 9AM game on
      Sunday! Yeah Glow needs to find their team and finish out the season. We
      are hearing Nour is promising a round of drinks for any of you that come
      to the games this weekend. Joking aside, this team can play when they show
      up and there’s a good chance they can have an excellent run in the
      playoffs if the numbers cooperate.

      Once Pink figures out how to score more than once a game it’s OVER for the
      rest you. I prefer good news before bad news so we have to shout out the
      defense on this team for holding Blue for the entire second half. You guys
      were working your pink pony butts off. Now for the bad news, you guys do
      have good players, we are just not convinced YOU guys know that. It feels
      like a different Pink team is playing every week; if they figure out the
      problem before playoffs, this team could have the best comeback the
      Womens+ division has ever seen.
