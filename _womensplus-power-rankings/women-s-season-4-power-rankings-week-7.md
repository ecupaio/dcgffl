  Anonymous! What a send off for Gay Bowl and this week’s bye. We partied hard
  at Trade and at least some of us played hard at Carter Barron. After this week
  we have only one regular season game left, and for the first time this season,
  the rankings are looking pretty stable. Let’s get into how the teams are
  stacking up after Week 7 in the DCGFFL. 
season: 4
week: 7

      It is a rare sight in this division to see a team party just as hard as
      they play. Big surprise that a team led by Judy, who rarely misses a
      Sunday Funday, would be the most social team in the division. Since there
      is no game to discuss, the only performance to analyze is this team’s
      showing at the Midseason Party. By no means was this team starting out
      slow but once word got out that the game MIGHT be canceled, Green took it
      as a personal challenge to make sure no one was in playing shape on
      Sunday. It’s a shame that the forfeit went their way because there is
      nothing these authors wanted more than to see this team full of rookies
      play through their first team wide hangover. Cheers to the bye!

      Three points separate Orange from being at the top of these rankings.
      That’s only for us to worry about, this team’s eyes are on the playoffs.
      This game had it all, last second TDs, INTs, and a very hungover QB and
      Captain. Amanda and Metz may have had more drinks at Trade than points on
      the scoreboard. Following in the Commanders footsteps, Meg B made it into
      the end zone with seconds left on the clock, but unfortunately Orange
      could not convert for the 2-pt conversion. Next game, bring back that
      pylon costume so Orange knows where the back of the endzone is. Even with
      two losses, this team is sitting pretty comfortable in this \#2 spot. With
      one more week of regular season games, Orange just needs to finish strong
      to keep their bye headed into the playoffs.

      If anyone had a chance to knock Forest Green from the top of the list, it
      was going to be this team. As the only team that has beaten Green this
      season, we were looking forward to a great game this weekend.
      Unfortunately, with another week missing Meg and Kori, this team decided
      it was better to have not played and lost than to have played at all. We
      will give them a pass this week for Gay Bowl and preventing injuries but
      we hope they finish out strong on their double header week. We know,
      nothing matters until playoffs, but maybe you can make an exception for
      the week before.

      I have taken to \*affectionately\* calling the Maroon team the Red Robins.
      If you listen verrrry closely, you will be able to hear them chirp from
      all the way across the field. Finally being able to get something started
      on both sides of the ball this week, Maroon looked like the team we hoped
      they would be at the beginning of the season. Travel practices must be
      working their magic on this team as they were showing off up and down the
      field. Turns out the secret is to put Shayne on both sides of the ball.
      There is one more game for Maroon to prove if they are currently better
      than a few other teams this season. We are holding our breath to see what
      they have for the end of the season.

      Congratulations to the Pink team for showing us that the only team they
      can beat is the Yellow team. This time around though, it was not even
      close. Usually on the other side of multiple INTs, the Pink team (Court),
      kept Yellow out of the end zone barring one unfortunate interception
      thrown on their 15. Could this mark the beginning of a legendary end of
      season run for the pink team? When we come back from our bye, Pink will
      round off their season with a double header against Blue and Maroon. If
      they keep up their streak against teams with a losing record, they just
      might be able to pull out a third win on the season.

      We were rooting for you! All season we have waited for something to
      connect with this team. Other than having more interceptions than
      completed passes, we are not really sure what the problem is for this
      team. You have to admire this team’s willingness to keep playing until the
      end despite the score. For that reason, don’t think that just because the
      record isn’t what they want that they won’t put up a fight into the final
      leg of this season.
