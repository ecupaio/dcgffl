  Anonymous! Week 8 has come and gone and teams are ready to fight for the
  championship. Will Forest stay atop the charts? Will Atomic prove it really
  only comes down to the playoffs? This duo cannot wait to see the action on the
  field and listen to all the chirping on the sidelines. For the first time in
  four seasons, W+ is ready for a REAL championship, where all QBs remember what
  weekend they were playing, no conflicts of interest, no wild rain storms, and
  six teams fighting for the top. May the odds be ever in your favor.

      Well, they did it. This team stayed atop the charts all season long. Never
      once did they truly crush an opposing team. Each win was carefully
      crafted, on average beating teams by 11 points. With Gay Bowl behind them,
      will this team full of Valkyries and Senators seek revenge and claim the
      Championship? Forest looked sharp against Neon Yellow this weekend, but
      Yeah Glow came out to fight, and Forest scored just 13 points against the
      six seed. QB/Safety Lynch is undefeated in regular season games, but has
      never played a true W+ Championship game. Will this be the year to take
      home the glory against another QB1 and not a backup who was begged to
      throw in the Championship game? Will Captain Judy finally get a
      championship and have a real reason to be shady to other teams? Will this
      team stop complaining about missed calls? We cannot wait to see what
      happens!

      The most fun team in the league, originally projected to finish in the
      lower half of rankings, has really shown up this season, letting us all
      know that you can win AND have fun! This team is so excited for the bye
      weekend to get brunch and drink Wisconsin “Old Fashioneds”, which leaves
      this duo concerned for what is being drunk in the Midwest. This past
      weekend, Citrus came out with a wild amount of points against Atomic Blue,
      with backup QB Elle at the helm. Meg B. snatched 19 points and an INT,
      pushing her into the season MVP conversation. This Duo is beyond excited
      for championship weekend, and hope to see an Orange vs Forest fight for
      \#1. Captain Amanda is also seeking her first Open or W+ Championship
      after many years of just being on the fun, but not so good teams. While
      it’s nice to make friends and dance Sundays away, it can only be sweeter
      with a trophy in hand. Cheers to them Squirting all over their competition
      all season!

      There is nothing we can say that would be harder to hear than the reality
      of Sunday. An early leader for the season, we are surprised that Blue sits
      here, just barely hanging onto the 3rd spot heading into the playoff
      weekend. Having not played together for a few weeks with 2 bye weekends,
      Blue was up to a slow start this weekend. Getting the kinks out during
      last week’s games, we know this team is ready to show off. The road to the
      championship for Blue is through Yellow and season favorite, Orange. If
      nothing matters until playoffs, now is the time for Blue to come out
      firing.

      Another week in the league, another week of trying to write the power
      rankings without an actual game. Instead, we will just predict how
      Maroon’s first game of the playoffs will go. Christine, fresh off her most
      recent travel, suddenly remembers that she is a captain and shows up on
      the sideline to coach making history as the only captain ineligible to
      play in playoffs in division history. At first glance, there is a cheering
      section on the sidelines but on a closer look we realize that it is
      actually the team’s fan preparing to yell at the refs on behalf of the
      team. Can’t risk penalties during playoffs. Last but not least, we will
      see a team hungry to show the rest of the division what they can do. This
      record does not reflect how much talent is on this team and after a season
      of fine tuning, don’t be surprised if they make a final comeback for a
      chance at the trophy.

      Last week we wrote that if Pink was lucky, they had a chance to come out
      of the season with a 3-6 record if they played how they did against
      Yellow. Like always, we were right...kind of. We just thought the win was
      going to be against Maroon. Pink has an edge on teams with losing records,
      which I guess is still right. In style points for the week, we have to
      give it to Pink for an impressive double Em play downfield for the
      touchdown. Followed closely by Alley’s spike and CB’s revenge immediately
      after bouncing the ball back into her face. After beating Blue, I wonder
      if Pink is kicking themselves for the early morning forfeit to Maroon. It
      would not have changed their game into playoffs but bragging rights
      would’ve probably been fun.

      This team has no reason to be the 6 seed. Watching them play all season,
      it’s a matter of attendance and organized chaos. When Yeah Glow is firing
      on all cylinders, they are close to unstoppable. QB Pam will throw an INT,
      but pick off the opposing QB on the next play. Lindsey will call a wild
      4th and 10-yd drive from Yeah Glow’s 15, and turn it into a 20-yd gain,
      yet somehow get stopped on 4th and goal, while the run is still open.
      Aubrie will jump like a dolphin into the air to make a wild catch, yet
      pull the pants down of an opposing receiver for a holding call. Chaos
      controlled could make a very interesting Sunday morning against the most
      even keeled QB in the league.
