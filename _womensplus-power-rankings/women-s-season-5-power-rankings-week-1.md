  We’re back! The formerly Anonymous Duo is no more, we will go by our real
  names this time. Just kidding, we really enjoy our pen name. Sorry for
  forgetting about the preseason rankings, but we were just too busy making sure
  Carter Barron was mowed, striped, and pre-divited, to allow for a great day
  one! Let’s say how everyone fared in week one, more specifically, who is in
  last and will ultimately complain to us on Sunday!

      This quiet bunch rolled up to the fields early to start practice a full on
      hour before gametime. We guess practice pays off, as they sailed past the
      Yeeters in week one. After a season off, QB Lizzie is back to run around
      and throw dimes to anyone ready to catch, on her team or not! New to the
      league, not to the game, Ebay came in hot making dynamic reads on offense
      and defense. We are excited to see how this stealthy team continues to
      play throughout the season, or if their cocky confidence will ultimately
      be a flaw.

      Lisa Z. is here and ready to run circles around us all, while still being
      sacked 4 times.. We are quite certain she could have thrown and caught her
      own passes this weekend, but she had her fleet of stellar receivers in tow
      to throw a pair of TDs. Red is the only team to draft exclusively
      receivers and decide to tell the concept of defense to go to hell.
      Luckily, Lisa was also in the backfield to play defense for the whole team
      too with 3 interceptions! We shall see what crazy scores this team puts up
      when Veteran Meg returns. There is no doubt that this team will secure the
      1 spot sometime this season with 14 receivers and one alpha QB, as long as
      they can keep their opponent’s scores to a low roar.

      We knew this team was going to be jolly, but also, holy giants! Shayne has
      finally found her favorite receivers, anyone over 6’ tall, to launch pop
      flies into the sky. Captain Jillian is keeping her coaching secrets safe
      under her new helmet; we all know it is not to protect from concussions.
      We are excited to see how this team unfolds and develops moving forward.

      Please hire them! Or was it please ref in their favor? Down a rookie
      player thanks to Carter Barron, Black set out to show us what they got.
      For political and legal reasons, we are not allowed to make jokes out of
      fear of losing our jobs as writers. Instead we sing the praises of the
      team that beat Coral by \*checks notes\* one point. Blame the refs not the
      players! We are excited to see what this team full of all stars can do for
      the rest of the season, as long as they are on the better fields.

      Another week one, another Lynch absence. It is also the only week that
      Nour will be running any actual routes. Hint: Lynch loves pitch plays and
      Nour will be on the line catching her breath for the rest of the season.
      Green rolled up on Sunday at 8:30 sharp and watched as Red was taught the
      basics of defense. After a grueling 20 minute warm up, Green managed to
      find their groove in the second half. The rest of the season is bright
      under this team’s leadership and we wouldn’t be surprised to see this team
      among the top teams for the rest of the season.

      The Yeeters looked strong out of the gate this weekend, but just needed a
      little momentum to get some points on the board. There is no doubt under
      the veteran leadership of Em and Ally of the Year Dana, they will start
      stringing some TDs together. This team has several rookies and second
      season players looking to shine. If their defense stays as strong as it
      was this past weekend, they will be in great shape to do some damage.

      Do not let the record deceive you, this is going to be a great team. With
      the cards stacked against them with a double header week one (brutal), I
      would say that these peaches did the best they could do. They shook off
      that rust from the long cold winter and started the season with a couple
      confusing plays. At first we thought it was just the sidelines confused,
      but unfortunately so was coral on the field. But, this team is led by last
      season’s winners so don’t think for a second they won’t make a giant peach
      style comeback.
