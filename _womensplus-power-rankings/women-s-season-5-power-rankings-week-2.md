      Peach Please scored the first touchdown,

      But the blue bloods would not sit and frown,

      The wind sure did swell,

      Taylor played like Odell,

      Will anyone come for their crown?

      The Ro-hoes went up by two scores,

      Then Seafoam roared back wanting more,

      Meg led a Brady-like drive

      With a clutch Lisa Z. dive

      This red team, we just can’t ignore!

      DEI Hires came in with a bang,

      They handily beat the Green Gayng

      Lindsey’s still got it,

      Retire? Hah! Not it.

      Their opponents can only say “Dang!”

      Seafoam played in this weekend’s double,

      First, they burst purple’s comeback bubble,

      Then they battled with red-

      Pam nearly lost her head!

      Come playoffs, this team could be trouble!

      For the first time, Lynch’s team is in last

      “Tied!” she corrects in a quick groupme blast.

      “Jayme F wasn’t there!”

      “This is really not fair!”

      Lynch, relax, we’re just getting you gassed!

      The Yeeters put up a good fight,

      But Seafoam was tough with their height,

      They look good in purple

      But nothing rhymes with purple

      Against Kelly, will they set the ship right?

      By ranking, Peach is in the pit,

      They also have shown us their grit,

      And with Metz in the shotgun,

      Plus the double-header done,

      This team will improve bit by bit!
