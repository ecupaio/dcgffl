      Jaime was polishing her football like she was trying to summon a genie in
      a bottle.🧞‍♂️ But someone must’ve rubbed that bottle the wrong way,
      because the second half against Blue and their second game of the day
      against Green came with ZERO wishes granted. 🚫 In their game against
      Green, the absences were loud, the drops were louder, and the hate from
      the sidelines? Deafening. But shake it off, Black. As the power rankings’
      receipts show, playoffs don’t care about a bad game. Or two. Or three. Or
      four.

      Blue’s reign has been unshakable—until now. A rare stumble for the
      league’s longtime scoreboard leaders. The first half was slow, but in the
      second half the momentum was building fast, and for a minute, it seemed
      like they might just run away with it. 🏃🏽‍♂️💨 But just as things were
      getting scary for Black, Carter Barron claimed another one, and the game
      was called early. It’s their first loss, but don’t get too comfortable. If
      they can bottle that second-half magic and stay healthy, they’ll still be
      a force to be reckoned with.

      Was it close? Yes. Was it enough? Also yes. Green took full advantage of a
      tired Black squad, chirping like they were up by 30 (and not just one)—but
      hey, a win is a win. The offense didn’t light up the scoreboard, but then
      again, it really didn’t need to. When the other team’s receivers are doing
      most of the work for you, sometimes you just have to stand there and look
      good.


      But yeah, props to the Granny Gayng 👵🏼 (ahem, I mean Green Gayng), who
      only had 8 players—two of whom had just run 10 miles for “fun”—and a whole
      team out of position. Maybe there is something to be said about age over
      beauty.

      Tall, taller, tallest… and Amanda. Chaos is the brand, and business is
      booming. Because Foam House is nothing if not visually chaotic…but it
      works. Shayne’s Chaotic Evil play-calling remains unmatched (shouting “go
      deep!” mid-pitch to a blocker? Certainly a choice). And Magneto is fully
      back into her villain era after being cleared by her PT.


      Word of the week? *Resilient*. Word of the game? *Ouch*. Carter Barron was
      taking names this Sunday, and once again it was Pam collecting another
      souvenir shiner, this time from friendly fire. But even when they’re
      crashing into each other, Seafoam finds a way. After all, it’s hard to
      defend a team that’s just as confused as you are. 🤔😵‍💫

      Watch out folks, it’s getting juicy! 🍑 Peach had a great day on Sunday
      with the addition of their newest receiver Forrest Gump, I mean Meg B.,
      who was trying to take a touchdown into the woods of Rock Creek. This
      enthusiasm was what Peach has needed all season though, and they took down
      the Ro-Hoes, a little too easily if you ask us. Rookie Sienna came out
      strong with an interception and TD, Metz started using her blockers to get
      small gains when they really mattered, and Meg continued to run through
      traffic, find space, and magically get open.


      Don’t sleep on the peaches, as they have some great momentum heading into
      the end of the season. We can’t wait to see if the Peaches can beat any
      other teams that aren’t Red.

      This team fought hard against Peach, but let’s be honest—the clock wasn’t
      on their side. Starting the day fashionably late (9:05 AM, after the coin
      toss? Classic), they seemed to learn that early mornings and high stakes
      don’t mix. Still, the Ro-Hoes showed flashes of brilliance—Lisa’s valiant
      effort at QB kept the Ro-Hoes in the game, rookie Parker snagged his first
      TD, and Catherine commanded the defense to keep the score as low as
      possible. The wideouts looked sharp, running crisp routes and pulling in
      some deep catches. All in all, a true team effort. Fortunately, this team
      has a QB who famously believes that “what happens on the fields only
      matters in the playoffs,” so here’s hoping that mindset works out for
      them. But maybe, just maybe, a few more wins and little better attendance
      before the postseason wouldn’t hurt. 🤷🏽‍♀️

      The Yeeters looked their strongest this week. Offense and defense were in
      sync, rookies shone bright, and Ashley took her rage on Shayne’s flags and
      Jillian’s face, giving Amanda a run for her rushing title with four sacks
      in a game. Lefler looked extraordinarily strong in the pocket, throwing
      two TDs, no INTs, and fought off the Foamies formidable rush (even though
      that was the most questionable call by the head ref)…rumor has it she’s
      training and microdosing with Aaron Rodgers on the weekends. Let’s hope
      this team keeps growing together and shows everyone up in the playoffs, as
      this is arguably our most kind and fun team in the league!
