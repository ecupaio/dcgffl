  Good-day flag football fans. For this week’s installment of the power
  rankings, the Anonymous Duo and Pass Rush Barbie 💄 were hijacked by a slew of
  frustrated quarterbacks, here to tell their side of the story…
season: 5
week: 6

      In a battle between chaotic evil (Shayne) and *calculated* evil (Jaimee),
      the latter reigned supreme. Fresh off their first loss of the season (Go
      Green!), Black came out swinging - no holds barred, all gas, no brakes.
      Jaimee orchestrated the perfect offensive *formula*, adding up just the
      right ratio of go routes, seam routes, and slants leaving Seafoam’s
      defenders still solving for X (see what we did there??). Seafoam fought
      valiantly, but let’s be honest—if you make it to the 5-yard line *t*wice
      and can’t punch it in, do you really deserve the W? We think not. Hats off
      to Black’s defense and Britt, who nabbed two critical sacks in the red
      zone. This team has all the pieces for a deep playoff run (as we knew from
      day one)—it’s them against the world (literally and figuratively).

      What is it about this team that seems to catch all the breaks? Is it their
      ripe old age? Their lucky green hue? Their dashing good looks? Whatever it
      is, green is on a roll - somehow winning games, even when the stat sheet
      says otherwise. Despite green’s veteran offense, make no mistake, this
      game was won on defense. Austyn and Amy came through with massive pick
      sixes – one of which was a 75-yarder with 5 seconds to go in the first
      half. Talk about a dagger! (Welcome to QB life @Tiff – it sucks; you’re
      gonna love it). Julianna and Anise continued to send shivers down the
      spines of blockers everywhere, while Mel, Nour, and Lexie were pulling
      flags like a Maytag washing machine (just go with it). If Lynch decides to
      finally start playing like she’s capable of (and remembers to put her
      flags on), and Jayme actually shows up for some games, this team is going
      to be tough to beat.

      No Lizzie? No problem. Well, not exactly *no* problem, but Royal kept
      things interesting with Tiff stepping into the QB role for the week. Tiff
      may not have found the endzone, but she connected to Taylor and Laila that
      hint at good things to come. With Ebay snagging an interception, there
      were flashes of the Royal squad we’ve come to expect. This team still has
      all the pieces, they just need to snap them back into place.

      Ro-Hoes said “roll the highlight reel” and then made sure they were in
      every frame. Meg was out there slinging passes, trying to go TikTok viral
      before the plug is pulled. Sarah was in beast mode, snagging a touchdown
      and playing so hard she practically left pieces of herself on the field.
      Maddie scored her first TD, Peyton goes deep, Catherine tallies up the
      sacks and Parker makes his QB debut. And just when you thought the credits
      would roll, Lisa gets the pick six and provides the PSA to not throw it
      anywhere near her. The only thing stopping this team as they climb up the
      ranks might be an inadvertent whistle. This team wasn’t in the red zone,
      they were the Ro-Hoe Zone.

      So much talent. So much height (minus Amanda). So much potential. Sadly,
      despite their best efforts -- Des' fingertip catches, Amanda's diving
      sacks, Elle's clutch grabs -- Seafoam couldn't quite slay the dragon (see
      above re: inability to finish). But don't count this team out yet.
      Calculated evil may have won this round, but some would put their money on
      chaotic evil in a potential playoff showdown. Either way, pop the
      popcorn—we are *so* here for it.

      Meg B is proving that 40 isn’t slowing her down with a touchdown and two
      interceptions in the Corals first win against any team other than Red.
      Metz tallied a TD of her own and connected with Lex to seal the deal
      against purple. Rookie Sienna grabbed an interception before they had to
      sprint off at half time to prepare for take off on the Blue Origin,
      probably. Not much movement in the rankings for Coral, but if this week
      has showed us anything with the Meg-Metz-Lex connections, Citrus is still
      getting real within these sweet peaches.


      Don’t sleep on the peaches, as they have some great momentum heading into
      the end of the season. We can’t wait to see if the Peaches can beat any
      other teams that aren’t Red.

      They say there are no moral victories in football, but damn if this one
      didn’t come close. The defense was *on fire*—Rach with the pick six,
      Pruitt pulling flags like it was a reflex, Court in full beast mode, and
      Dana laying her body on the line like it was a championship game. Offense
      showed moments of brilliance but unfortunately it wasn’t quite enough to
      get over the hump. Safe to say the entire league is rooting for this squad
      to break through and notch that long-awaited first win next week. And with
      playoffs right around the corner - anything can happen.
