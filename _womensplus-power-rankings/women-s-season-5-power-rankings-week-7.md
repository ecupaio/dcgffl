  Pass Rush Barbie 💄ft. the Anonymous Duo and The Huddle Daddy. Fresh off the
  travel roster drop… questionable choices, hurt feelings, and playoff dreams
  hanging by a thread. The tea on the sidelines? Piping hot. And no, Sam wasn’t
  the only one sipping. I saw it all, my loves. Let’s dive in:

      Black finally put some bass in the “I” of DEI and it showed. No longer the
      lowly DEI hires, they’re now the boss. They played hard to secure that
      coveted bye week and now get two weeks to sip champagne and polish their
      trophy shelves.


      Ca$hmoney cashed in on all fronts, with catches that turned as many heads
      as their mid-season party dance moves, Vic’s multiple TDs were truly
      insane, and T’s leadership turned a ragtag group of DEI hire “underdogs”
      (or so they’d have you believe) into a powerhouse team.


      With two weeks to chill, let’s just hope they don’t get too comfy in their
      penthouse C-Suite—because the rest of the league is still out for that
      number one spot. Only time will tell if Black thrives under pressure…or if
      their champagne goes flat and the trophy shelf stays empty.

      The Grannies—ahem, Gayng Green—flexed their veteran experience with Lynch
      and Ash proving to be a menacing combo on offense and Austyn shutting the
      door on a late Foamie TD like a bouncer who’s seen enough for one night.
      But don’t worry, this time Jayme got to stay and watch it until the
      end—though judging by the sideline commentary, she was more than ready for
      it to be over far sooner than it was.)


      Green is riding a six-game winning streak and looking ahead to their next
      matchup against Purple, one thing’s for sure: The Grannies have the
      experience and firepower to take care of business, but don’t sleep on
      Purple—they’ve got a lot of heart and have shown they’re capable of
      surprising.

      Red’s redemption arc is loading…assuming they can find the starting lineup
      first. Even so, Meg managed to do dirty work handing the Yeeters their
      only loss of the day. Word on the field is that all that hustle was just
      penance for throwing a pick on the very first offensive play—but hey,
      repentance looks good on her and if she keeps that same fire next week,
      the Peaches might just get puréed.


      What more is there to say about a game that was much closer at points than
      it should have been? Not much. So, we’ll just give credit where credit is
      due: Red clawed their way back from a 0–13 hole in the first ten minutes.
      And for a brief, shining moment, they gave Purple something to believe
      in—and we loved seeing the light in their eyes.


      Next up, they’ll face off against Coral. And while Coral’s Daddy energy
      might be enough to shake things up and give us a competitive playoff game,
      Red’s got the experience and heart to pull this one off. Assuming, of
      course, they can actually field a full team. But hey, here’s hoping.

      Blue and the Yeeters were making so much noise on the field that we almost
      missed the green-on-green bloodbath. (Almost.)


      From undefeated darlings to playoffs underdogs—Blue’s tumble has been
      tough to watch. And last week’s loss to Purple marked a new low in what’s
      been a brutal streak of setbacks and injuries. But don’t count them out
      just yet! They may be missing their QB, \#1 draft pick, and their all-star
      rusher, but there’s still fight left in this team. And they’ll need every
      ounce of it in their face off against The Foamies—undeniably the league’s
      most chaotic team. While Taylor’s back is strong, it’s not strong enough
      to carry the whole team—but if Seafoam’s receivers keep running into each
      other, she just might not have to.


      One thing is for sure: if Blue can capitalize on the Foamie’s disorder,
      these Queens might just dance their way into a playoff win.

      Move over, Black-on-Black crime — this week’s focus is on Green-on-Green
      crime. Because at Carter Barron, *All Lives (aka Team Colors) Matter*.
      We’re just inclusive like that—especially since “there are good people on
      both sides.” And I may be biased, but The Foamies looked good out there
      and held their own against the Granny Gang (a team I’ve heard is
      collectively old enough to have stormed the beaches of Normandy…But I
      digress...). The expected chaos ensued, Shayne reminded everyone that if
      you give her an inch, she’s taking a mile (on foot, no less), and Munroe’s
      bad ass punt return kept things spicy.


      Next up, The Foamies turn their chaos cannon on Royal Blue. If they can
      keep the mayhem pointed in the right direction, they just might splash
      their way into the next round.

      The Metz-Big Bubs Daddy duo brought all the same chemistry from the drag
      stage to the field—and for a minute, it almost looked like it might be
      enough to crack Black’s momentum. (Almost). And while the Daddies may not
      have cracked Black, they didn’t go down without a little glitz and grit.


      Now, Coral’s got another shot at glory—and this time it’s against the
      Ro-Hoes. They have a lot riding on this matchup. It’s notoriously hard to
      beat a team more than once…ahem, we mean more than twice in one season.
      And for most of the season, Red was the only team Coral could beat—and
      while we don’t always root for the underdog, we do love a dramatic
      threequel.


      If history repeats itself, which unfortunately it already has, we have no
      doubts Coral could pull off this playoff win. And if they pull it off? One
      thing’s for sure: Red will certainly know who their daddy is.

      Watch out league—there’s a new QB in town. Fresh off an Italian getaway,
      backup QB Nik stepped in and breathed new life into a beleaguered Purple
      squad, leading them to their first win of the season after a loss earlier
      in the day to the Ro-Hoes.


      While their warm up game against Red didn’t quite deliver the results they
      were hoping for, the Yeeters pulled out all the stops in their game
      against Royal Blue and proved that “teamwork makes the dream work”. Pruitt
      ran it back with a pick-six like the OG LP she is, Dinora was wreaking all
      types of havoc, and Chels came through not once, but TWICE when it
      mattered most. Let’s just hope it wasn’t all just a dream… and that they
      don’t go right back to sleep, because their next game against the Granny
      Gayng might be their toughest yet. And while we can never really know what
      the next week holds, one thing’s certain: Judy won’t be anywhere near the
      sidelines for this one.


      We’re not betting on a Purple upset…but let’s be real, we’d love to see
      it. But for now, let’s give the Yeeters their flowers for last week’s
      performance—they’ve earned it.
