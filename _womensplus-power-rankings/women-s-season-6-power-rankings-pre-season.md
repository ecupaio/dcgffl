  Is that a rainbow? A U-Haul? Oh no, it’s just a bunch of gays dusting off
  their cleats.   A new season means new storylines, new dynasties, and yes—your
  favorite all-seeing, shade-throwing correspondents are back. 💄🕵👯‍♂️  Now
  that the rosters are locked, only one question remains: Who built a
  dynasty…and who is primed to be the upset of the season? Let’s dive in to our
  preseason reactions:
season: 6
week: 0
rankings:

      Two QB’s, multiple MVPs, and a roster stacked higher than a Vegas bet. If
      they don’t end up on top, it’s because too many aces don’t always make a
      winning hand. But if we’re betting gays… this hand is certainly too good
      to fold.

      Of all the colors in the spectrum, we give you corn—and if these Corn
      Stars know anything, it’s how to put on a show. With a QB who nearly took
      the crown last season, a rusher fast enough to break the sound barrier
      (no, really—you’ll hear her before you see her), and a roster popping with
      talent, one thing’s for sure: if they play to their abilities, you’ll
      certainly want a front row seat to the show.

      If there’s a team we expect to do the most, it’s certainly this one.
      Clearly manifesting a medal with that name, the Lesbian Alloyance comes
      loaded with talent, grit, and personalities as bold off the field as they
      are skilled on it. After all, metal is forged under fire—and this season
      will test whether the Alloyance can withstand the heat and come out
      shining, or fade into tarnish.

      With seasoned Sinners who know how to raise hell on and off the field, and
      bright-eyed rookies eager to be christened in mud, sweat, and unapologetic
      gay energy, this team has the makings to be just as captivating as a
      Sunday service. And while we can never really know what this season has in
      store, if the chemistry clicks, the plays connect, and the hips keep
      moving, the only thing that could stop them is divine intervention.

      With two travel QBs—one now donning the captain’s crown—Icy Hot has a
      roster with all the right ingredients. And if our all-knowing crystal ball
      is right, and this team truly harnesses their abilities, they could be the
      underdog story of the season—and just might leave the rest of the league
      feeling the burn.

      Another season, another Seafoam—sure, we could’ve picked a new shade from
      the rainbow, but you’ll be glad we didn’t. Because if there’s any roster
      guaranteed to give you FOMO, it’s this one. Bursting with talent, good
      vibes, and leadership who knows how to set the tone, this team has all the
      right parts to be the underdog story of the season.
