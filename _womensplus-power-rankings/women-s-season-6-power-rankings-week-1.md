  The Anonymous Duo 👯‍♀️ (ft. Pass Rush Barbie 💋)  Welcome back leaguers! We
  have your week 1 update, complete with your favorite authors’ shady opinions.
  As always, the views we express are our own (that we heard all of YOU saying
  on the sidelines). Now, allow us to recap the good, bad, and the messy from
  week 1.

      The tennis players weren’t the only ones serving at Carter Baron this
      Sunday. The Cardinal Sinners delivered a service of their own, featuring
      Court’s fantabulous *gaybuet* at QB. Supposedly forbidden to run by her
      wife…yet there she was, proving those legs aren’t just for show (and yes,
      the moms on the sideline noticed).


      Clearly still salty about that \#4 preseason prediction, the Sinners
      stormed the field to set the record straight. And it was giving
      deliverance—which was served piping hot to the Foamosexuals. This game had
      it all: multiple interceptions, a shutout, Bre rising from the dead (AKA
      out of retirement) with a pick 6, and the Sinners’ fearless leader Jayme
      arguing over calls with the ref even though they were up by a ton.
      Honestly, the only thing missing from this game was a confessional booth
      for Seafoam to repent and wipe the slate clean.

      Battle Royale didn’t disappoint—the Grassholes and Corn Stars put on a
      show only returning QBs could deliver. In the end, Green squeaked by with
      a one-touchdown win—though rumor has it a full-strength Corn squad
      might’ve dealt them a very different ending. I guess we’ll never know…at
      least not until their Week 6 rematch.


      Still, the Grassholes earned it. Chelsea T lit up Corn’s defense with
      three TDs, the O-line held last season’s rusher of the year to just one
      sack, and they even pulled off the impossible—sacking one of the league’s
      most unsackable QBs, Lynch.


      Next up is their matchup with the Cardinal Sinners—and if there’s anything
      we know, it’s that one of these teams is about to be humbled. Winning the
      battle is one thing, but winning the war is far harder—and if any roster
      looks ready for the fight ahead, it’s Green.

      I’m not saying I have a problem with democracy, but I will say that this
      writer was outvoted to put this team at 4. If we were ranking defenses
      alone, Silver came out the clear winner as the only side of the ball to
      actually score, which we are sure is a Womens+ first. Despite the
      offense’s best efforts fighting for about 60 yards the whole game, this
      team is proof that defense truly does win games. Highlights include 2
      rookies making an early name for themselves and longtime player Sophie
      clinching the game with a pick 6 in OT. No matter the shade we throw, a
      win is a win and if this team’s defense came swinging like this, the
      writers can only imagine how fierce this team is going to be with an
      offense to match.

      If you were on the sidelines, you would’ve assumed that Meg L. Was sacked
      approximately 30 times, but the children of the corn may be more bark than
      bite. New captain Lefler kept it calm, even as the game started to slip
      away. They were missing some key players, but there’s no reason that this
      team is not at least number 2. There is nothing that lights a fire under
      this team’s QB more than trending down in the rankings, let’s hope she
      starts winning in both w+ and open, before there is a corn-rising.

      There was a lot that went right with Blue week 1, though jerseys were not
      one of them. Rookie league QB Ashley and first time captain Metz’s team is
      looking great coming out of week 1. With a loss only in name, their
      defense managed to keep Silver out of the endzone the entire game. Though
      considering the muddly slip and slide CB was this weekend, they might have
      done them a favor. Don’t let the record fool you, this team has some
      weapons. Des managed an impressive 3 INTs before she realized her jersey
      was on backwards and their rush maintained heavy pressure throughout. We
      have no doubt that next week, they will be fighting to prove how hungry
      they are for an early season win.

      The Foamies 2.0 took the field on Sunday and showed flashes worth
      watching. Their fearless leader Dana reminded everyone why she wears the
      captain’s crown, grabbing a pick-six and anchoring a defense that refused
      to quit. There were also game-saving moments sprinkled throughout, proof
      that this roster has real brilliance waiting to be unlocked.


      Yes, the chemistry is still in progress, and yes, the scoreboard stung,
      but every new team has its growing pains. What matters is the Foamies
      stayed unshaken—and with the weapons they’ve got, this team has everything
      it needs to turn potential into power.


      Next up: They take on Team Icy Hot. Underdog vs. Underdog. Only one climbs
      out of the bottom, and Seafoam’s betting it’s them.
