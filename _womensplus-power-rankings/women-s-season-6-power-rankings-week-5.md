  The Anonymous Duo 👯‍♀️ and Pass Rush Barbie 💄   Last Sunday served up gloomy
  skies, gloomier spirits, and a serious case of the drops. Not the raindrop
  kind we expected — but the pass-dropping, ranking-dropping, flag pull-flopping
  kind. We have a LOT to discuss and since some of us are furloughed with
  nothing better to do than sit and ponder rec football, this week’s rankings
  should be good and shady. Let’s get into it.

      Welcome back to the top, Sinners. Feels good to be back home, doesn’t it?
      Another Sunday another day for rookie QB Court to pull off another
      impressive win this week. The sinners shuffled a few roles, tried some new
      looks, and even in the chilly fall morning weather this team was still too
      hot to handle. Also too hot to handle: Jayme’s hips – at least according
      to our eyes, after watching several Blue defenders get a little too handsy
      while going for her flags, and ultimately ending up with a flag of their
      own.


      Cassie Z. delivered a standout performance on offense, OG Bre reminded
      everyone she’s a threat anywhere you put her, and Maddy? A game with her
      perched at the rush puck is one your QB and blockers won’t forget.


      Next up: Another familiar feeling as the Sinners once again faceoff
      against a newly victorious Seafoam.

      Well, well… the Grassholes certainly lived up to their name this week. The
      lean, mean Green Machine came in short-handed and high-strung, with
      players pulling double duty on both sides of the ball. This game had it
      all: four sacks, three QBs, two QB touchdowns, one game-winning
      interception, and a -5 yard punt. What more can you ask for on a windy
      Sunday?


      Meg L. remains the league’s most versatile QB, snagging a receiving
      touchdown on a pass that was totally, definitely, and for sure meant for
      her. Ironically, she might’ve been the only Grasshole without a case of
      the drops. And judging by that grin, she seemed to enjoy life on the other
      side of the ball—maybe the grass is really greener over there after all.
      <br>


      While the Grassholes may have come up short in numbers and score, there
      was no shortage of… let’s call it “spirit.” The rule that “only captains
      talk to refs” works best when the captain isn’t the one yelling at the
      ref. It got heated (though mostly on their side) as Silver seemed to be
      having a lovely time and were relatively good sports, even though they
      seemed to have poked the bear.


      Still, this was Green’s first loss of the season, and if we know anything
      about the Grassholes, it’s that they don’t take losing lightly. Consider
      this your warning Corn Stars.

      Light Blue walked so Silver could run — and run they did, straight into
      the record books as the only team to shut down Forest Green this season.
      In their game against the Grassholes, the Chromies’ reminded everyone that
      their shiny roster wasn’t just for show when they arrived looking calm,
      confident, and completely in sync. Em polished off her throwing arm and
      stepped into the QB role and took home her first W in the backfield. Sharp
      arm, steady reads, and hips far too slick for Green’s defense (thanks Meg
      B.).


      If this game showed us anything, it’s that Silver’s week one defensive
      dominance wasn’t luck, it was a preview—one Green got to fully experience.
      Sophie took home another game winning INT and rookie Lauryn managed 4
      sacks. Though there could have been a few ‘illegal’ down field plays, this
      team shows that they will edge out a win by any means necessary.


      Next up: The “Chromies” take on Icy Hot — a match up we’re personally
      quite excited to see.

      8:59 a.m. rolled around, and no one was entirely sure this game was even
      going to happen. But Lefler stayed calm and collected, stepping in as
      captain and QB. Thankfully for the Children of the Corn, the ever-gracious
      Seafoamies were kind enough to play 6v6 until Corn’s full roster arrived.


      The game started rough, though — two pick-sixes before Amanda exclaimed
      from the sidelines, “Do we not have wrist coaches?!” Luckily, Seafoam’s
      kindness continued when they loaned Lefler one of her QB’s infamous wrist
      coaches. The result? Two immediate TD drives. Miraculous what a little
      organization (and sportsmanship) can do.


      Maya, so tall, towered over her opponents snagging passes from Lefler —
      and even one from opposing QB Kat. Mal, after showing up fashionably late,
      shiner and all, had every dump pass down the field, drive after drive.
      Iris somehow Odelled a ball over her defender. Q, as usual, flew through
      the sky catching so many passes and defending like a rock star. Even Baby
      Bubs came out from the sidelines to punt in Reeboks and glasses. Although
      Corn eventually found their footing, Seafoam stormed the Corn Palace and
      brought the Kingdom tumbling down.


      Next up: The Corn Stars face off against a pissed off Forest Green, so
      grab a seat, because this one is bound to be good.

      The first-half scorecard didn’t have much to report for Blue. A few
      unfortunate drops (we’re blaming the wind) and some post–Gay Bowl cobwebs
      made for an unexciting start. Whatever Metz said at halftime worked,
      though, because they came out looking like a completely different team.
      Ash V.’s passes were crisp and her blockers were plenty. Dinora’s rush
      (and near interception) was enough to put the fear of God in the Sinners;
      and rookie Angie was out there leaping for balls and dodging flag pulls
      with the grace (and luck) of someone the ref didn’t quite catch in time.


      Unfortunately, being down three touchdowns at the half proved too much to
      recover from, but don’t count this team out just yet. With eager receivers
      ready to pad the stat sheet once the wind settles and the jet lag fades,
      Icy Hot might just be the sleeper upset of the season.


      Next up: they take on a familiar foe in their matchup against the
      Chromies.

      The Foamies’ kindness and patience finally paid off: our crystal ball was
      right, and QB Kat finally found the end zone in their game against Corn.
      And Seafoam came away with more than just points on the board, they won.


      They went in down a few stars, with captain Dana and all-star Aubrie
      sidelined for the season, but you wouldn’t have known it. Things started
      off typical enough—Kat nearly throwing a pick (thanks to a nice block by
      Mal), but then, somehow, the ball landed back into Kat’s hands and she ran
      for about a 5 yd gain. Sure, she threw one right after, but the Foamies
      kept their spirits high and their energy higher.


      Then the near impossible happened. Down by 1 point after Lauran G took two
      INTs to the house in the first half. Pretty much everyone scored. Kat was
      like Oprah. You get a point, You get a point, Ash, Lauran, Cali, KP, you
      get a point! Maybe it was all the ice tea she’s drinking on the sidelines
      or maybe it was the lack of alcohol during the game, we’ll never know.
      Whatever it was, this team is hopeful to continue their streak against the
      red hot sinners next week, especially if Anisa can pull another record 5
      sacks…


      Next up: the Foamies take on the red-hot Sinners. Let’s see if they can
      keep up the momentum for an exciting repeat next week.
