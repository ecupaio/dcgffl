  The Anonymous Duo 👯‍♀️ and Pass Rush Barbie 💄   You want to know what it’s
  like when ChatGPT writes the rankings? Well, here you go. Your favorite
  all-knowing gays were booked and busy this week — so we outsourced it. And
  before you open your mouths - - - or your GroupMe chats - - - to pass
  judgment, just remember: we gave these rankings just about the same amount of
  effort you all gave on the field last Sunday — just enough.
season: 6
week: 6
rankings:
  - team: _womensplus-teams/s06-women-s-cardinal.md
    record: 4-1

      The Sinners stay perched on the top branch, overlooking a weary and
      beleaguered kingdom plagued by player injuries and absences. Their rule
      isn’t flashy — it’s efficient. They strike quickly, celebrate minimally,
      and move on. The rematch with Green next week is one you won’t want to
      miss.

      Green bounced back after last week’s loss and looked like their old selves
      again. Their defense was locked in, and the offense finally clicked. When
      they’re focused, they’re hard to stop — and they know it. Their rematch
      with Cardinal is one you won’t want to miss. Both teams think they’re the
      best, and on Sunday we will see which one actually is.
  - team: _womensplus-teams/s06-women-s-silver.md
    record: 3-2

      Silver remains unpredictable — the team equivalent of a controlled burn.
      Some weeks, they scorch everything in sight; others, they simply smolder.
      The pieces are all there — they just don’t always show up at the same
      time. Still, this team can hang with anyone when they’re locked in. They
      face Corn next, and honestly, no one has any idea what’s about to happen.
  - team: _womensplus-teams/s06-women-s-light-blue.md
    record: 2-3

      Light Blue found some rhythm, and for the first time, it looked
      sustainable. They’re calm where they used to be frantic, confident where
      they used to guess. Still, a double header on a cold morning will test
      both lungs and temperament. Let’s hope they can bring the heat to this icy
      morning.
  - team: _womensplus-teams/s06-women-s-corn.md
    record: 1-4

      No one expected Corn to be here — least of all them. Their season feels
      stuck in limbo: flashes of what could be, followed by long stretches of
      frustration. They’re too talented to stay down for long, but the clock’s
      ticking for the Corn Stars to start playing like the team everyone
      expected. And maybe they’ll get to do just that when they take on Silver
      on Sunday…maybe.
  - team: _womensplus-teams/s06-women-s-seafoam.md
    record: 1-4
    text: >-
      Seafoam lives in the world of the almost. Almost there, almost scoring,
      almost turning their season around…almost. The defense stays solid, and
      the vibes are good, but it’s time to turn “almost” into “actually,” which
      they may get a chance to do when they take on Team Icy Hot.
