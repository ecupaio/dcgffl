  The Anonymous Duo 👯‍♀️ and Pass Rush Barbie    If you caught a whiff of
  something in the air last Sunday, no, it wasn’t your gloves. It was the
  unmistakable scent of playoffs creeping closer — which apparently reeks of
  Tiger Balm, sports wrap, bruised egos, and…Fireball. And with everyone surely
  going full send for the weekend’s Halloween festivities, we’re guessing
  Sunday’s air will smell somewhat the same — only stronger, and with notes of
  hangover and regret.  Here’s how the rankings stand heading into another
  chaotic Sunday.

      The Sinners stay on top after a nail-biter so close, half the team thought
      they’d lost. Turns out, they didn’t — but just barely. They pulled off a
      one-point win over Forest Green in a matchup that already feels like a
      preview of the championship to come.


      Next up, they’ll face doubleheaders against Corn and Silver. If they can
      survive the schedule, then that top spot is solidly theirs.

      The Grassholes started their doubleheader the way they usually do — slow,
      smug, and in control. They let Seafoam hang around through the first half,
      maybe out of charity, or maybe just for sport, before flipping the switch
      and bursting the Foamies’ last bubble of hope. Sarah L. grabbed not one
      but two highlight-reel interceptions, and the Meg-to-Meg connection was
      every bit as dangerous as anticipated. Guy Fieri, we mean Ashley H, even
      managed to score some points! But their second game against Red was the
      complete opposite — a grind from start to finish and easily the most
      physical matchup of the day and likely a preview of what’s to come in the
      final.


      Next up: A break from the double headers when they take on Team Icy Hot.

      We want to take this moment to formally welcome Shayne back to the league.
      Who else can we count on to motion before every single play? With blockers
      and speedy receivers like that, who can blame her? This team has a sneaky
      way of staying on the top half of our rankings. Though they were in the
      lead the entire game, there was a moment we thought Corn could make a
      comeback. Fortunately for Silver, they seem to know Field 1 like the back
      of their hands, unfortunately for Corn they did not with an unlucky
      pothole ending what could’ve been a game winning drive.


      Next week, Silver has their DH against Seafoam and first time opponent,
      Cardinal. I have no doubt that the winner will be determined by whichever
      team is less hungover from the weekend. I’m sure that everyone plans to be
      on their best behaviors this weekend. 😈

      Their game against light blue was the kind of game where even the refs
      looked like they needed a nap. Quarterback swaps, trick plays, and enough
      confusion to make you wonder if Corn’s playbook was written mid–Fireball
      shot. But the Corn Stars are nothing if not entertaining. At least they
      look they’re having fun.

      Game 1 was a rough outing for the Icy Hots. The highlight being Katie’s
      great hands for large gains. We will spare the details here, except for a
      moment to highlight the hungover refs, who frequently had no idea what
      down it was….


      Game 2 was a much better showing with a back and forth game between
      Seafoam. Somehow Des managed to jump every ball, even after 3 games in a
      day. Cee came out as the winner of wig day looking like Dijonai Carrington
      on the field and snatching an INT. At one point, they looked like Icy Hot
      was going to come away with the win, but the chaos of Seafoam’s roster was
      just too much to handle. Let’s see if this team can heat up for the rest
      of the season or they will remain in their chilly state until the
      playoffs.

      Sunday was a big ask for the bodies of this deteriorating team, but as
      always, the vibes were high. Their first game against the Grassholes was
      rough — endless go routes, deep balls to no one, and a few generous gifts
      to the other team. But by Game 2 against Icy Hot, the Foamies finally
      found their footing. Who knew Kat could run and juke? Certainly not us.
      Lauran G. and KP locked down the line, opening space for Ash Y. to pull in
      40-yard passes like clockwork. On defense, Cali and KP grabbed
      interceptions, the rush kept constant pressure, and for a minute there, it
      looked like everything was clicking.


      Then, just as the game tied and things got interesting… Kat’s calf said
      “absolutely not.” Ash Y, jack of all trades, jumped in at QB and carried
      the team to a win — impressing the sideline spectators. With two wins
      under their belt this season and a series of close games recently, can
      this team move up in the rankings? Or will the loss of four starters be
      too much for this team to bear? Regardless of their place in the
      standings, this team is always smiling, laughing, and shows up in greater
      numbers to every party than to their games on Sundays. Please feel free to
      buy a foamy a drink on Sunday, they’re guaranteed to have a good time.
