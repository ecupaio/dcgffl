  Pass Rush Barbie (ft. The Anonymous Duo 👯‍♀️)  There are always two sides to
  every story — especially when everyone thinks they’re the good guy. And if we
  were objective journalists, we’d tell you both. But we’re not, and after last
  week’s games (or lack thereof, for some), it’s pretty clear who’s walking into
  playoffs with halos and who’s…well…not. So let’s get to it.

      Oh, you Sinners already know where you stand: VILLAIN. This was the
      easiest “villain” designation to hand out after witnessing their match up
      with Light Blue.


      If you’re wondering how a team stacked with some of the kindest people in
      the league could possibly be the villains, let’s review a few of the
      cardinal sins they’ve committed this season: *thou shall not bull rush*,
      *thou shall not draw thy opponent’s blood before halftime*, *thou shall
      not commit pass interference with that much enthusiasm…*the list goes on.


      So here we are, crowning them the villains, and there they are, finishing
      the regular season on top — with a bye, a target on their backs, and a
      trail of bodies (that they most certainly left bruised) quietly rooting
      for some team—literally any team—to knock them out during the playoffs.

      Our second VILLAIN designation of the day goes to 🥁🥁🥁… Forest Green,
      because no one likes a crybaby!


      Our resident constantly aggrieved and perpetually misunderstood team
      managed to finish the season as the second seed, the team with the
      greatest point differential, clinch the bye, and somehow still find time
      to gripe about the playoff schedule.


      Still, credit where it’s due — the Grassholes have been one of the
      toughest, most consistent, and most dominant teams all season, managing to
      make every game a grind for their opponents (whether at full strength or
      running lean with players pulling double duty). But, beneath that mean,
      green, dominating exterior lives a tender “inner sprout” 🌱 still craving
      validation from the refs over a season’s worth of “missed” calls
      (validation we fear will never come…but hey, we’ve been wrong before!)


      Anyways — enjoy your bye, Grassholes! You’ve earned the rest and, let’s be
      honest, probably a few things to complain about.

      By default more than merit, we’re crowning Silver as the heroes in their
      matchup against Forest Green. We seriously considered giving both teams
      the villain designation, and while that could’ve been a nice plot twist,
      we ultimately opted to preserve narrative balance. So there you go,
      Chromies — this first halo’s all yours. 🫴👼


      Their game against Forest Green was longer, more dramatic, and a little
      louder than it needed to be — but to be fair, most of the whining came
      from their opponents. And since we’re being fair, we’ll also go ahead and
      “retract” what we said in last week’s power rankings about Silver bringing
      too much physicality to their match up against Cardinal Red (for the
      reasons you’ve seen above…). Though, in our defense, it’s hard to take
      retraction requests seriously from a team whose quarterback literally took
      out a rusher last weekend and managed to receive ref calls none of us have
      ever heard of…two weeks in a row.


      They may not have secured the bye, but if the playoff calendar rumors are
      true, the path forward might still work in their favor. Some might call
      that convenient. Others might call that luck. But we’ll call it what it
      is: board favoritism. 🙃

      Another “hero” by default (courtesy of forfeit).


      The Corn Stars walked away with the easiest and least impressive win of
      their season after Seafoam couldn’t field a team, and secured a little
      extra rest and recovery heading into playoffs.


      They’ve got momentum, swagger, and versatility, so record aside, don’t be
      surprised if Corn stays in the championship conversation — and, depending
      on who you ask, at the center of a few conspiracy theories about that very
      convenient playoff schedule. 👀 After all, one team’s hero is another
      team’s villain, especially when you’ve got the golden child.

      In a matchup that had everyone on the edge of their seats, Light Blue
      proved themselves the heroes in their game against Cardinal Red by nearly
      pulling off the upset of the season and giving everyone on the sidelines a
      good show.


      If there was ever a game to remind the league (and its top seeds) that the
      mighty can, in fact, stumble, it was this one. Blue completely controlled
      the first half — multiple interceptions, relentless defensive pressure
      that shut down the Sinners drive after drive, and two touchdowns that had
      everyone on the sidelines whispering, “Wait… are they winning?” and
      “Seriously, by that much?!”


      They even forced Cardinal’s Kori into their toughest performance yet —
      having to fight every instinct to sub themself in (despite being injured,
      in jeans, and without cleats) as they paced the sidelines watching their
      team end the first half down BAD.


      Sure, Cardinal came back with a vengeance after the half, but that
      first-half beatdown delivered by Icy Hot was a reminder that anything can
      happen in the playoffs, and that the only thing to expect is the
      unexpected.

      The Foamosexuals are the villains (by forfeit).


      We were rooting for you! We were all rooting for you! But alas… Seafoam
      didn’t even make it to the field this week and handed Corn the easiest win
      of the season with a forfeit.


      After a year defined by grit, good vibes, and a shocking number of
      injuries, this wasn’t exactly the storybook ending we hoped for — but it’s
      not surprising. Bodies are bruised and morale’s been tested, so we get it.
      Here’s hoping they can rest, recover, and rally in time for the
      postseason, because if there’s any team we trust to bounce back and bring
      the energy into playoffs, it’s the Foamies.
